<h3>ON THE PROPOSED SUGGESTIONS FOR PRESERVING A
RECORD OF EXISTING MONUMENTS.</h3>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>The following communications have reached us since the publication of
  our remarks on the proposed <span class="sc">Monumentarium
  Anglicanum</span> (No. 73. p. 217. et seq.). They serve to show how much
  interest the subject has excited among those best qualified to judge of
  the great utility of some well-organised plan for the preservation of a
  record of our still existing monuments.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Dunkin's</span> letter (which was accompanied by
  a copy of the prospectus issued by him in 1844) claims precedence, as
  showing the steps which <i>that</i> gentleman has already taken. It is a
  communication highly creditable to his exertions in the cause, but does
  not alter our views as to the practicability of any successful attempt to
  accomplish this object by individual exertion.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In No. 73. Vol. iii. of "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>"
  you have honoured me by an allusion to the <i>Monumenta Anglicana</i> I
  have in the press, as "a plan which would have your hearty concurrence
  and recommendation, if it were at all practicable; but which must fail
  from its very vastness." It may be so; but the motto of my family is
  <i>Essayez</i>. Every "gigantic scheme" must have a commencement, and
  this "scheme," I am perfectly aware, is one "that no individual, however
  varied in attainments and abilities, could without assistance hope to
  achieve." My father, upwards of half a century since, commenced
  collecting mortuary memorials; many of the monuments from which he copied
  the inscriptions have since been destroyed by time, and many, very many,
  more by the ruthless innovations of beautifying churchwardens. These
  "very vast" collections&mdash;the labour of a life&mdash;however, only
  form a portion of the materials I now posses; for since I issued my
  prospectus in 1844, I have received many thousands of inscriptions and
  rubbings of brasses from clergymen and others; and I trust I shall be
  favoured with still further assistance, as in all cases where information
  is rendered, the source whence derived shall be most thankfully and
  freely acknowledged. <!-- Page 314 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page314"></a>{314}</span></p>

  <p>The plan I have adopted with regard to arrangement is to folio each
  page three times, viz., i. each parish by itself; ii. each county; iii.
  alphabetically; so that each parish can be considered complete in itself;
  each county can be bound up by itself; or the whole alphabetically,
  gazetteer-wise.</p>

  <p>The index will be also in three divisions,&mdash;i. general; ii. names
  of places; iii. names of persons.</p>

  <p>With regard to the number of volumes,&mdash;I need not say that that
  is entirely <i>in nubibus</i>. My impression is limited to seventy-five
  copies, the same as my father's <i>Oxfordshire</i>, with which it
  corresponds in size.</p>

  <p>I should have preferred seeing the government performing the task of
  preserving manuscripts of all existing monuments; but it is the fashion
  in Britain for government to leave all apparently national undertakings
  to individual exertion. I will here conclude with a quotation from the
  report I have just published of the Transactions at the Congress of the
  British Archæological Association held in Worcester:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Lamentation is, however, worse than useless: the spirit of the age
  forbids all idle mourning. If we would awaken a sympathy and interest in
  our pursuits, we must gird up our loins like men, and be doing, and that
  right earnestly; for it is hopeless any longer waiting for the
  government, as a 'Deus ex machina,' to help us to rescue our antiquities
  from destruction."</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>Our next is from a correspondent (who has favoured us with his name)
  who proposes a scheme almost more extensive than that advocated by <span
  class="sc">Mr. Dunkin</span>, but who differs from that gentleman by
  recognising the necessity of combined endeavour to carry it out.</p>

</div>

  <p>A few years since I propounded a scheme for an <i>Ecclesiologicon
  Anglicanum</i>, or record of the history, not only architectural and
  monumental, but also local and traditional, of every parish in England.
  Though I had long conceived such a design, I must confess myself indebted
  to some excellent remarks on the subject which appeared in the
  <i>Ecclesiologist</i> (New Series, No. x., April 1846). Fully aware that
  so stupendous a work could never be accomplished by any single
  individual, I compiled a prospectus of my design, and invited the
  co-operation of all antiquaries. I proposed to publish at intervals, and
  in alphabetical order, the parishes of every county, and by dividing the
  labour among different coadjutors, and giving to each a separate branch
  of inquiry, thereby insuring, by successive revisions, a certainty of
  correctness, I hoped to succeed in the undertaking. My project was,
  however, laid aside by reason of other engagements; but, as I still think
  it worthy of consideration, I have troubled you with these "Notes" in the
  hope that, by publication in your pages, they may be the means of
  suggesting to others interested in the matter the practicability of
  carrying them out. Though with no definite object in view, but with a
  presentiment of their after utility, I have, during many provincial
  campaigns, collected architectural notes, as well as genealogical
  memoranda, from the churches I have visited. To these, such as they are,
  any of your readers is welcome, for the purposes to which I have
  referred, and I know many who would gladly send their contributions to
  such an undertaking.</p>

  <p class="author">W. J. D. R.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>Our next letter, though brief, is valuable as furnishing a case in
  point, to prove the practical utility which would result from the
  realisation of some well-considered scheme for the attainment of the
  great national object which we are advocating.</p>

</div>

  <p>As an instance of the practical use of such a collection, let me
  inform your readers that in 1847, being engaged in an ejectment case on
  the home circuit, it became most important to show the identity of a
  young lady in the pedigree, the parish register of St. Christopher le
  Stocks only giving the name and date of burial. I found that when St.
  Christopher's was pulled down for the enlargement of the Bank of England,
  some kind antiquary had copied all the monuments. The book was found at
  the Herald's College; it contained an inscription proving the identity,
  and a verdict was obtained.</p>

  <p class="author">J. S. B.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Our last communication is, we have reason to believe, from an active
  and zealous Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, who would heartily
  co-operate in carrying out the practical suggestions thrown out in his
  letter.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In Vol. iii, p. 218., you suggest that the Society of Antiquaries is
  the body which should undertake the task of forming a record of existing
  monuments in churches. Entirely agreeing in the opinion you have
  expressed, I would venture to offer some remarks on the subject. The
  undertaking is a vast and laborious one, and can only be effected by
  great subdivision of labour.</p>

  <p>That the Society of Antiquaries is the fittest agent for the work, I
  think admits of little doubt; its Fellows are widely spread throughout
  the country. In every neighbourhood may be found one or more gentlemen
  able and willing to give their aid, and to excite others to assist. The
  Archæological Institute and the British Archæological Association would
  doubtless add the weight of their influence, and the personal assistance
  of their members.</p>

  <p>The clergy throughout the country would be able and willing labourers;
  and surely these conjoined forces are adequate to the occasion.</p>

  <p>One consideration suggests itself, viz., whether <!-- Page 315
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page315"></a>{315}</span>the record be
  confined to monuments in churches, or whether it should be extended to
  those in churchyards? I think it should be so extended,
  partially&mdash;that is, that <i>all</i> the monuments in churches should
  be given; and such of the monuments in churchyards as, upon a careful
  inspection, may appear to be in any way worthy of preservation. We do not
  perhaps want the ten thousand "afflictions sore" which ten thousand John
  Smiths are stated to have "long time bore."</p>

  <p>The inscriptions in churches should be accompanied with rubbings of
  all brasses; and, as far as possible, with drawings of the most
  interesting monuments.</p>

  <p>I am satisfied the thing can be done, if it be undertaken with
  prudence, and continued with energy. The copies should be certified by
  the signature of the person making them, and they should all be
  transcribed on paper of the same description, so that they might be bound
  in volumes.</p>

  <p>The expense would probably be considerable, because in some instances
  paid labour might be requisite; but it would be as nothing compared with
  the magnitude and importance of the result; and if, as is probable, the
  Society of Antiquaries might hesitate at undertaking the whole charge, I
  doubt not that many would contribute towards it, and amongst them</p>

  <p class="author">Q. D.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>A very slight consideration of the object which it is proposed to
  accomplish, and the means by which it can be attained, will show that it
  falls properly into three distinct operations, namely, Collection,
  Preservation, and Publication.</p>

  <p>The first and most important is, the Collection of Materials. In this,
  it is obvious, the co-operation of individuals well qualified for the
  work may be secured in all parts of the country, provided some
  well-defined plan of operation is furnished for their guidance, by some
  recognised centre of union. A Committee of the Society of Antiquaries,
  who should well consider and determine upon some uniform plan of
  recording the inscriptions, &amp;c., is clearly the body who, from their
  position, could most effectually, and with the greatest propriety, issue
  such circulars. That the Antiquaries would in this receive the support of
  both the Archæological Societies, there cannot, of course, be any
  doubt.</p>

  <p>And as we have in the Society of Antiquaries a machinery already
  established for the proper collection of the materials, so we have an
  existing and most appropriate place for their preservation in the British
  Museum, where they may be consulted at all times, by all parties, with
  the greatest facility, and free of charge.</p>

  <p>These two great points, then, of Collection and Preservation, it is
  clear may be attained at an expense so inconsiderable, compared with the
  benefits to be gained from their accomplishment, that we cannot believe
  in their failure from want of funds.</p>

  <p>For the accomplishment of the third great end, that of Publication,
  there is no existing machinery. But let the work of collection and
  preservation be once fairly entered upon&mdash;let it be seen how
  valuable a collection of materials has been gathered ready to the hand of
  a Society which should undertake its publication, and there need be
  little fear that from the supporters of the various Antiquarian,
  Archæological, and Publishing Societies, now spread throughout the
  country, there would be found plenty of good men and true ready to lend
  their aid to the printings and publishing of the <span
  class="sc">Monumentarium Anglicanum</span>.</p>

  <p>But as the first step is <span class="sc">Collection</span>&mdash;and
  that step is the one in which the <span class="sc">Society of
  Antiquaries</span> can best move, we trust that the present year, in
  which this Society celebrates the centenary of its chartered existence,
  will be signalised by its promotion of such a Record of Existing
  Monuments as is here proposed; which cannot be otherwise
  regarded&mdash;(and we use the words of the Society's Charter)&mdash;than
  as "good, useful, honest, and necessary for the encouragement,
  advancement, and furtherance of the study and knowledge of Antiquities
  and the History of this Country."</p>

  <p><i>The Pilgrimage to Canterbury.</i></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Whanne that April with his shoures sote</p>
      <p>The droughte of March hath perced to the rote,</p>

      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; * &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *</p>
      <p>Befelle, that in that seson, on a day."&mdash;<i>Prologue.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I quote these lines because I wish to show that Tyrwhitt, in taking
  them as indicative of the very day on which the journey to Canterbury was
  performed, committed a great mistake.</p>

  <p>The whole of the opening of the prologue, down to the line last
  quoted, is descriptive, not of any particular day, but of the usual
  season of pilgrimages; and Chaucer himself plainly declares, by the words
  "in <i>that</i> seson, on <i>a</i> day"&mdash;that the day is <i>as
  yet</i> indefinite. <!-- Page 316 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page316"></a>{316}</span></p>

  <p>But because Tyrwhitt, who, although an excellent literary critic, was
  by no means an acute reader of his author's meaning, was incapable of
  appreciating the admirable combination of physical facts by which Chaucer
  has not only identified the real day of the pilgrimage, but has placed
  it, as it were, beyond the danger of alteration by any possible
  corruption in the text, he set aside these physical facts altogether, and
  took in lieu of them the seventh and eighth lines of the prologue quoted
  above, which, I contend, Chaucer did not intend to bear any reference to
  the day of the journey itself, but only to the general season in which it
  was undertaken.</p>

  <p>But Tyrwhitt, having seized upon a favourite idea, seems to have been
  determined to carry it through, at any cost, even at that of altering the
  text from "<i>the Ram</i>" into "<i>the Bull</i>:" and I fear that he can
  scarcely be acquitted of unfair and intentional misquotation of Chaucer's
  words, by transposing "his halfe cours" into "half his course," which is
  by no means an equivalent expression. Here are his own words:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"When he (Chaucer) tells us that 'the shoures of April had <i>perced
  to the rote</i> the drought of March' (ver. 1, 2.), we must suppose, in
  order to allow due time for such an operation, that April was far
  advanced; while, on the other hand, the place of the sun, 'having just
  run <i>half his course in the Ram</i>' (ver. 7, 8.), restrains us to some
  day in the very latter end of March. This difficulty may, and, I think,
  should, be removed by reading in ver. 8. the <span
  class="sc">Bull</span>, instead of the <span class="sc">Ram</span>. All
  the parts of the description will then be consistent with themselves, and
  with another passage (ver. 4425.), where, in the best MSS., the <i>eighte
  and twenty</i> day of April is named as the day of the journey to
  Canterbury."&mdash;<i>Introductory Discourse.</i></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Accordingly, Mr. Tyrwhitt did not hesitate to adopt in his text the
  twenty-eighth of April as the true date, without stopping to examine
  whether that day would, or would not, be consistent with the subsequent
  phenomena related by Chaucer.</p>

  <p>Notwithstanding Tyrwhitt's assertion of a difficulty only removable by
  changing the Ram into the Bull, there are no less than two ways of
  understanding the seventh and eighth lines of the prologue so as to be
  perfectly in accordance with the rest of the description. One of these
  would be to suppose the sign Aries divided into two portions (not
  necessarily <i>equal</i> in the phraseology of the time), one of which
  would appertain to March, anal the other to April&mdash;and that Chaucer,
  by the "halfe cours yronne," meant the <i>last</i>, or <i>the April</i>,
  half of the sign Aries. But I think a more probable supposition still
  would be to imagine the month of April, of which Chaucer was speaking, to
  be divided into two "halfe cours," in one of which the sun would be in
  Aries, and in the other in Taurus; and that when Chaucer says that "the
  yonge Sonne had in the Ram his halfe cours yronne," he meant that the
  <i>Aries half of the month of April</i> had been run through, thereby
  indicating <i>in general terms</i> some time approaching to the middle of
  April.</p>

  <p>Both methods of explaining the phrase lead eventually to the same
  result, which is also identical with the interpretation of Chaucer's own
  contemporaries, as appears in its imitation by Lydgate in the opening of
  his "Story of Thebes:"</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Whan bright Phebus passed was the Ram,</p>
      <p>Midde of Aprill, and into the Bull came."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And it is by no means the least remarkable instance of want of
  perception in Tyrwhitt, that he actually cites these two lines of
  Lydgate's <i>as corroborative of his own interpretation</i>, which places
  the sun <i>in the middle of Taurus</i>.</p>

  <p>I enter into this explanation, not that I think it necessary to
  examine too curiously into the consistency of an expression which
  evidently was intended only in a general sense, but that the
  groundlessness of Tyrwhitt's alleged necessity for the alteration of "the
  Ram" into "the Bull" might more clearly appear.</p>

  <p>I have said that Tyrwhitt was not a competent critic of Chaucer's
  practical science, and I may perhaps be expected to point out some other
  instance of his failure in that respect than is afforded by the subject
  itself. This I may do by reference to a passage in "The Marchante's
  Tale," which evinces a remarkable want of perception not only in
  Tyrwhitt, but in all the editors of Chaucer that I have had an
  opportunity of consulting.</p>

  <p>The morning of the garden scene is said in the text to be "er that
  dayes eight were passed of the month of <i>Juil</i>"&mdash;but, a little
  further on, the same day is thus described:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Bright was the day and blew the firmament,</p>
      <p>Phebus of gold his stremes doun hath sent</p>
      <p>To gladen every flour with his warmnesse;</p>
      <p>He was that time in Geminis, I gesse,</p>
      <p>But litel fro his declination</p>
      <p>In Cancer."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>How is it possible that any person could read these lines and not be
  struck at once with the fact that they refer to the 8th of <i>June</i>
  and not to the 8th of <i>July</i>? The sun would leave Gemini and enter
  Cancer on the 12th of June; Chaucer was describing the 8th, and with his
  usual accuracy he places the sun "but litel fro" <i>the summer
  solstice</i>!</p>

  <p>Since "Juil" is an error common perhaps to all previous editions,
  Tyrwhitt might have been excused for repeating it, if he had been
  satisfied with only that: but he must signalise <i>his edition</i> by
  inserting in the Glossary attached to it&mdash;"<span
  class="sc">Juil</span>, <i>the month of July</i>," referring, as the sole
  <!-- Page 317 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page317"></a>{317}</span>authority for the word, to this very line
  in question of "The Marchante's Tale!"</p>

  <p>Nor does the proof, against him in particular, end even there; he
  further shows that his attention must have been especially drawn to this
  garden scene by his assertion that Pluto and Proserpine were the
  prototypes of Oberon and Titania; and yet he failed to notice a
  circumstance that would have added some degree of plausibility to the
  comparison, namely, that Chaucer's, as well as Shakspeare's, was a
  <i>Midsummer Dream</i>.</p>

  <p>It is, perhaps, only justice to Urry to state that <i>he</i> appears
  to have been aware of the error that would arise from attributing such a
  situation of the sun to the month of July. The manner in which the lines
  are printed in <i>his</i> edition is this:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8hg3">"ere the dayis eight</p>
      <p>Were passid, er' the month July befill."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It is just possible to twist the meaning of this into <i>the eighth of
  the Kalends of July</i>, by which the blunder would be in some degree
  lessened; but such a reading would be as foreign to Chaucer's astronomy
  as the lines themselves are to his poetry.</p>

<h3>THE ACADEMIES OF SIR FRANCIS KYNASTON AND
SIR BALTHAZAR GERBIER.</h3>

  <p>Among the many interesting associations connected with old Covent
  Garden and its neighbourhood, we ought not to overlook Sir Francis
  Kynaston's "Museum Minervæ."</p>

  <p>In the year 1635, King Charles the First granted his letters patent to
  Sir Francis Kynaston, "Esquire of the body to his Majesty," whereby a
  house in Covent Garden, which Sir Francis had purchased, and furnished
  with books, manuscripts, musical and mathematical instruments, paintings,
  statues, antiques, &amp;c., was appropriated for ever as a college for
  the education of the young, nobility, and others, under the name of the
  "Museum Minervæ." Sir Francis Kynaston was made the governor with the
  title of "regent;" Edward May, Thomas Hunt, Nicholas Phiske, John
  Spidell, Walter Salter, Michael Mason, fellows and professors of
  philosophy and medicine, music, astronomy, geometry, languages, &amp;c.
  They had power to elect professors also of horsemanship, dancing,
  painting, engraving, &amp;c.; were made a body corporate, were permitted
  to use a common seal, and to possess goods and lands in mortmain. (Pat.
  11 Car. pt. 8. No. 14.) In the following year, 1636, was published,
  dedicated to the "Regent and Professors," <i>The Constitutions of the
  Museum Minervæ; giving an Account of an Academy for teaching chiefly
  Navigation, Riding, Fortification, Architecture, Painting, and other
  useful Accomplishments</i>.</p>

  <p>The "Museum" seems to have been highly patronised, for we find that on
  the 27th February, 1635 (the year of its foundation), Prince Charles, the
  Duke of York, and the Lady Mary their sister, honoured it with their
  presence to witness a masque, entitled "Corona Minervæ," which was
  written and prepared for the occasion by Sir Francis Kynaston. This
  masque was, I believe, printed in the year of its production, but I do
  not find it mentioned in the last edition of the <i>Biographia
  Dramatica</i>.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cunningham, in his <i>Handbook of London</i>, mentions (p. 42.)
  that</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Sir Francis Kynaston, the poet, was living in Covent Garden in 1636,
  on the east side of the street towards Berrie" (Bedfordbury).</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And again, in his notice of Bedford Street (p. 44.), he says, Sir
  Francis resided "on the west side in 1637." Both these entries refer to
  the same residence&mdash;a noble mansion, built in the year 1594, which,
  after being inhabited by several important families, finally passed into
  the possession of Sir Francis Kynaston, who altered and adapted it
  (rebuilding some portions) as the college of the "Museum Minervæ." The
  ground plan, which is now before me, exhibits a well-arranged and
  commodious building with two fronts, one in what is now Bedfordbury, and
  the other (probably added by Sir Francis) in the street now called
  Bedford Street. The building, when Sir Francis Kynaston purchased it in
  1634, stood in the centre of a large garden. The surrounding
  streets,&mdash;King Street, New Street, Bedford Street, Chandos Street,
  Henrietta Street, and Bedfordbury, were not commenced building until the
  year 1637.</p>

  <p>The "Museum Minervæ" is not named in Mr. Cunningham's excellent
  <i>Handbook</i>; but when we take into consideration the enormous amount
  of information required for a work of the kind, we ought not to blame the
  author for a few trifling omissions.</p>

  <p>Sir Balthazar Gerbier, an enterprising projector of the same century,
  by profession a painter and an architect, but now scarcely remembered as
  either, seems to have imitated the "Museum Minervæ" in an academy opened
  at Bethnal Green in 1649. Here, in addition to the more common branches
  of education, he professed to teach astronomy, navigation, architecture,
  perspective, drawing, limning, engraving, fortification, fireworks,
  military discipline, the art of well speaking and civil conversation,
  history, constitutions and maxims of state, and particular dispositions
  of nations, "riding the great horse," &amp;c. Once in each week, at three
  o'clock in the afternoon, Sir Balthazar gave a public lecture gratis on
  the various sciences. The lectures were <!-- Page 318 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page318"></a>{318}</span>generally advertised in
  the <i>Perfect Diurnal</i>, and a few curious specimens of these
  advertisements may be seen in Lysons' <i>Environs of London</i>, ed.
  1795, vol. ii. p. 30.</p>

  <p>Balthazar Gerbier was born at Antwerp about 1591, came young into
  England, and was a retainer of the Duke of Buckingham as early as 1613.
  Upon the accession of Charles the First, he was employed in Flanders to
  negociate privately a treaty with Spain. In 1628 he was knighted at
  Hampton Court; and, as he says himself in one of his books, was promised
  by the king the office of surveyor-general of the works, after the death
  of Inigo Jones. In 1637 he was employed in some private transactions of
  state; and on the 13th of July, 1641, he took the oaths of allegiance and
  supremacy, having a bill of naturalisation. In 1648 he appears to have
  projected the above-named academy, the failure of which very soon
  happened. Sir Balthazar then went to America, where he seems to have been
  very ill treated by the Dutch, and narrowly escaped with his life. He
  afterwards returned to England, and designed the triumphal arch for the
  reception of Charles the Second. He died at Hempsted-marshal, in 1667,
  whilst engaged in superintending the mansion of Lord Craven, and was
  buried in the chancel of that church.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, it may be as well to mention, that, prior to the
  establishment of the "Museum Minervæ," a committee had been appointed in
  the House of Lords, consisting of the Duke of Buckingham and others, for
  taking into consideration the state of the public schools, and method of
  education. What progress was made in this inquiry is not known, but in
  all probability the academies of Sir Francis Kynaston and Sir Balthazar
  Gerbier owed their origin to the meetings of this committee.</p>

<h3>SHAKSPEARE AND FLETCHER.</h3>

  <p>I feel greatly obliged to your correspondent C.&nbsp;B. for the attention
  he has bestowed on the question of Fletcher's connexion with <i>Henry
  VIII.</i>, as it is only through the concurrent judgments of those who
  think the subject worthy of their full and impartial consideration, that
  we can hope to arrive at the truth. His remarks (Vol. iii., p. 190.) are
  the more valuable, as they coincide with a doubt in my own mind, which
  has, to a great extent, ripened since I last communicated with you on the
  subject; and, indeed, I have no need to hesitate in saying, that I had
  more difficulty in coming to a conclusion with regard to the scene (Act
  III. Sc. 2.) in which the passages occur quoted by C.&nbsp;B., than with any
  other scene in the whole play. The suggestions, that Shakspeare might
  have touched scenes of which the mass had been written by Fletcher, is a
  point which I had not overlooked, and which indeed, to some extent, might
  be said to follow from the view I took of the relation of Shakspeare and
  Fletcher as master and scholar. Yet this suggestion is especially
  valuable regarding this scene, and may account for that which, without
  it, is not so easily explained.</p>

  <p>If, however, there be any lurking notion in your correspondent's mind,
  that the scene in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> (Act III. Sc. 1) referred
  to by X.&nbsp;Z. (Vol. iii., p. 139.) is, judging from certain coincidences of
  expression, an interpolation, and not by Shakspeare, I beg at once to be
  allowed to express my total dissent from such a view. Whether, also,
  there may have been any secondary allusion to some known event of the
  day, as X.&nbsp;Z. supposes, and as is by no means improbable, I cannot say;
  but I protest against its being said that the scene referred to is
  "totally unconnected with what goes before, and what follows." Antony is
  the hero of the play; and this scene shows the culminating point of
  Antony's fortunes, when his very successes turn against him.</p>

  <p>To return to <i>Henry VIII.</i>, the compliment to the Queen, to which
  your correspondent refers, is, as he very justly observes, brought in in
  a very forced manner. This, to my mind, is very strong evidence;
  otherwise I should not think it unworthy of Shakspeare. And it still has
  to be borne in mind, that he would have had to accommodate his characters
  and circumstances to the views of another writer. Shakspeare's spirit was
  too catholic, too universal, to have allowed, in a work entirely his own,
  even his Wolsey to have made use of the term "a spleeny Lutheran;" yet
  neither in the passage in which this expression occurs, nor in the one
  above referred to, is the versification characteristic of Fletcher. For
  my own part, however, I cannot recognise Shakspeare's spirit in this
  antagonism of creeds, which is, perhaps, even more strongly displayed in
  the prophetic speech of Cranmer's in the last scene, wherein he says,
  "God shall be truly known!" It may be said, that in both these instances
  the expressions are true to the characters of Wolsey and Cranmer. It may
  be so; for both are wanting in that ideal elevation which Shakspeare
  never fails to give. That, with this reservation, he becomes the
  mouth-piece of each character, is most true; and a curious instance of
  the writer's utter forgetfulness of his assumed character of contemporary
  with the events he is relating, occurring in Act. IV. Sc. 2 where
  Griffiths says&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"He was most princely: ever witness for him</p>
      <p>Those twins of learning, that he rais'd in you,</p>
      <p>Ipswich and Oxford! <i>one of which fell with him</i>,</p>
      <p>Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;</p>
      <p>The other, though unfinish'd, yet so famous,</p>
      <p>So excellent in art, <i>and still so rising</i>,"&mdash;</p>
    </div>
  </div>
<p><!-- Page 319 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page319"></a>{319}</span></p>

  <p>has no parallel in Shakspeare's works. To John Fletcher, indeed, at
  the close of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, these things were known; but
  scarcely to the attendant of Queen Katherine, who has but just narrated
  the circumstances, then newly happened, of Wolsey's fall. On maturer
  consideration, then, I am inclined to think that the whole of the scene
  (Act III. Sc. 2.) to which your correspondent refers, was originally
  written by Fletcher, although, as it now stands, it is strongly marked by
  the hand of Shakspeare. In the same category, also, I am inclined to
  place Scenes 3. and 4. of Act II. It will be observed that these changes
  are not inconsistent with the view I had previously taken; the effect
  being merely, that I am inclined to ascribe a little more than in the
  first instance to the hitherto unsuspected participator in the work. I am
  not sure, too, that I shall not be coming nearer to <span class="sc">Mr.
  Spedding</span>; as, if I am not mistaken, it is in some of these scenes
  that he imagines he detects "a third hand;" a theory which, though I do
  not adopt, I certainly have not confidence enough to reject altogether.
  But this view affects so very small a portion of the play, that it is of
  very little consequence.</p>

<h3>ILLUSTRATIONS OF TENNYSON.</h3>

  <p>That great poets are sometimes obscure, needs no proof. That the
  greatest poets will necessarily be so to the ordinary reader, seems to me
  equally indisputable.</p>

  <p>Not without effort can one enter into the spontaneous thought of
  another, or even of himself in another mood. How much more when that
  other is distinguished from his fellows by the <i>greatness</i> and
  <i>singularity</i> of his thoughts, and by the extreme subtilty of their
  connecting links. Obscurity is not a blemish but an excellence, if the
  pains of seeking are more than compensated by the pleasures of finding,
  the luxury of <span title="mathêsis" class="grk"
  >&mu;&alpha;&theta;&eta;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>, where the
  concentrated energy of a passage, when once understood, gives it a hold
  on the imagination and memory such as were ill sacrificed to more diluted
  clearness.</p>

  <p><i>Grandis præfatio tenui incepto</i>&mdash;a sort of apology to
  Tennyson for implying that he needs illustration. Some time ago I made a
  few notes on particular passages in <i>Locksley Hall</i>, which I now
  enclose. Some of them are, I dare say, superfluous&mdash;some, possibly,
  erroneous. If so, they will stand a fair chance of being corrected in
  your valuable publication.</p>

  <p>By the bye, if a "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>" had
  existed in the days of Æschylus, we might have been saved from many a
  recourse to "corrupt text" and "lacunæ admodum deflendæ."</p>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Notes on Locksley Hall.</i></p>

  <p>Stanza 2. "Dreary gleams:" in apposition with "curlews." I know the
  construction of this line has puzzled a good many readers.</p>

  <p>Stanza 23. "Yet it shall be." Yet "decline" thou certainly wilt.</p>

  <p>Stanza 28. "He will answer," &amp;c. With an oath, it may be&mdash;at
  the least with a coarse rebuff.</p>

  <p>Stanza 29. "The heart's disgrace." The disgrace, the injury, and
  degradation the heart has suffered&mdash;its prostitution to a mercenary
  service by a marriage of interest.</p>

  <p>Stanza 34. "Never." Alas! I never can.</p>

  <p>Stanza 35. "In division of the records of the mind." In dividing my
  recollections of her into two groups, and erasing the one.</p>

  <p>Stanza 38. "The poet is" (as I think has been already pointed out)
  Dante.</p>

  <p>Stanza 40. "He hunts," &amp;c. He&mdash;thy husband.</p>

  <p>Stanza 42. "Never, never," &amp;c. Never again! (joys never to return)
  sung by the ghosts of years departed.</p>

  <p>Stanza 51. "I have but an angry fancy"&mdash;my only
  <i>qualification</i>.</p>

  <p>Stanza 53. "But the jingling of the guinea," &amp;c. But there is no
  fighting now: the nations get over their quarrels in another way&mdash;by
  the jingling of the guinea, instead of the clang of arms.</p>

  <p>Stanzas 54. "Mother-age."; 93. "Mother-age, for mine I know not."</p>

  <p>This mother-age is a great difficulty. At first I took it for <i>the
  past of history</i>, but now understand by it <i>the past of his own
  life</i>, at least its earliest and brightest period&mdash;that age which
  had been as a mother, the only mother he ever knew.</p>

  <p>Stanza 70. "Youthful joys." The bright hopes of his youth. (?)</p>

  <p>Stanza 75. "Blinder motions," Less rational, less well-guided
  emotions.</p>

  <p>Stanza 91. "The distance." The distant future, the "good time
  coming."</p>

  <p>There are some lines in <i>In Memoriam</i> (I have not the book at
  hand, but any reader thereof will instantly recollect them), which
  indicate Tennyson's acquaintance with and appreciation of Jeremy Taylor,
  who thus expresses the thoughts of the "wild fellow in Petronius,"
  suggested by the sight of a floating corpse.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That peradventure this man's wife, in some part of the Continent,
  safe and warm, looks next month for the good man's return or, it may be,
  his son knows nothing of the tempest: or his father thinks of that
  affectionate kiss which is still warm upon the good old man's cheek ever
  since he took a kind farewell; and he weeps with joy to think how blessed
  he shall be when his beloved boy returns into the circle of his father's
  arms."&mdash;<i>Holy Dying.</i></p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Sacramental Wine</i> (Vol. iii., p. 179.).&mdash;From a note by
  <span class="sc">Mr. Albert Way</span>, on the use of sacramental wine,
  one would be led to infer that it was recommended on account of some
  superstitious belief in its superior excellency from having been used in
  religious worship; but I would suggest that the same reasons which
  recommend Teynt wine, the kind generally used for the Sacrament, are
  those which have established for it a reputation in cases of sickness:
  these are its rich red colour, and sweet and agreeable flavour.</p>

  <p>Weakness is popularly supposed to be caused by a thinness and want of
  blood; if wine be recommended for this, there is a deeply rooted
  prejudice in favour of red wine because the blood is red, and upon no
  better principle than that which prescribes the yellow bark of the
  barberry for the yellow state of jaundice; the nettle, for the
  nettle-rash; and the navel-wort (<i>Cotyledon umbilicus</i>), for
  weakness about the umbilical region. The truth is, that rustic practice
  is much influenced by the doctrine of similitudes, the principle of
  "<i>similia similibus curantur</i>" having been more extensively
  recognised in the olden time than since the days of Hahnemann.</p>

  <p>The sweetness of Teynt wine would recommend it for children, to whom a
  stronger wine is generally distasteful; but Port is generally prescribed
  as a tonic for adults.</p>

  <p>It may further be remarked, that the recommendation to give
  Sacramental wine might arise from the fact, that, as in some parishes
  more wine is provided than is required, the remainder is put by to be
  given to the poor who may require it at the hands of the clergyman.</p>

  <p>In sending these remarks, I am led to request that your correspondents
  would make Notes upon such old wives' remedies as are employed upon the
  principles I have mentioned.</p>

  <p>I next transcribe the following lines from the same MS. as my last. It
  is another epitaph on the Mr. Browne that I mentioned in No. II. It

<h3>POETICAL COINCIDENCES, ETC.</h3>

<p class="cenhead"><i>Byron.</i></p>

  <p>In the <i>Jealous Lovers</i> of Thomas Randolph, the following passage
  occurs, which may possibly have suggested to Lord Byron the fearful curse
  he has put into the mouth of Eve, in "the grand and tremendous drama of
  <i>Cain</i>."<a name="footnotetag1"

  <p>That exquisite stanza in the Third Canto of <i>Childe Harold</i>,
  "Even as a broken mirror," &amp;c., has been often admired. In Carew's

  image:</p>

    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To the coincidences which have been already pointed out regarding that
  exquisite line in the <i>Bride of Abydos</i>:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The mind, the music breathing from her face,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>the following from Carew may perhaps be added:</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p class="hg3">"The harmony of colours, features, grace,</p>

      <p>To this dark vault."&mdash;<i>Epitaph on the Lady S.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>All will recollect the wonderful description of the shipwreck in
  <i>Don Juan</i>; and more particularly the incidents so graphically
  related in stanzas 52 and 53 of the Second Canto: to a part of which, the
  following passage fro Lee's <i>&OElig;dipus</i> bears some
  resemblance:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i6hg3">"Methought I heard a voice,</p>
      <p>Now roaring like the ocean, when the winds</p>
      <p>Fight with the waves; now in a still small tone</p>
      <p>Your dying accents fell, as wrecking ships,</p>
      <p>After the dreadful yell, sink murm'ring down,</p>
      <p>And bubble up a noise."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>I have now before me a print of John, the first Lord Byron, engraved
  from a painting in the collection of Lord Delaware; in which he is
  pourtrayed in armour, with a truncheon in the left hand, and the <i>right
  arm bare</i> to above the elbow. Can this have suggested to Lord Byron
  the idea of describing "Alp the renegade" as fighting with "the white arm
  bare," in the <i>Siege of Corinth</i>?</p>

  <p>Byron refers to Smollett as an authority for "blatant beast,"
  apparently forgetting that the figure originated with Spenser. Again, in
  a note to <i>Don Juan</i> respecting his use of the phrase "reformadoes,"
  he remarks:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Baron Bradwardine, in <i>Waverley</i>, is authority for the
  word."</p>

  <p>It occurs, however, in Ben Jonson, and may be found in Blount's

<h3>THE REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO.</h3>

  <p>Amidst the Apennines, far removed from the ordinary track of tourists,
  is the diminutive republic of San Marino, which boasts never to have been
  subjugated. Whether it has escaped invasion because it has escaped
  notice, or because burglars never attack an empty cottage, is a point
  which I shall not stop to discuss. Few travellers visit it, but the
  trouble of doing so would be amply repaid. The situation is highly
  romantic; and the view from the summit of the bold escarpment, upon which
  the town is perched, extends over a wilderness of mountains.</p>

  <p>The population of the territory is said not to exceed 6,000 or 7,000
  souls. Its whole income is derived from a moderate duty on tobacco; and
  its standing army (for it possesses this indispensable incident to
  political independence) is chiefly employed in vain attempts to prevent
  the evasion of that duty.</p>

  <p>Among the greatest and most highly esteemed curiosities of the place,
  is a statue of Christ on the cross, with a head of real hair, which is
  cut twice a year, and always grows again! This faculty of reproduction is
  as profitable as it is wonderful; for, besides the resort of pious
  visitors, drawn by the capillary attractions of such a miraculous piece
  of sculpture, the locks that are cut off are stated, by the
  ecclesiastical functionaries in charge of the statue, to be a sure
  preservative against all harm to the wearer, and are of course in request
  as an article of commerce. My object in communicating to you these notes,
  is to introduce to you a copy, which I transcribed myself, of one of the
  state papers preserved in the archives of the republic. It appears to be
  a letter of encouragement, addressed by the Priors and Gonfaloniere of
  the republic of Florence to that of S. Marino, during a siege that the
  latter was undergoing. Perhaps some of your readers may be able to point
  out the precise occasion that called for the letter.</p>

<h3>ST. FRANCIS.</h3>

  <p>I think Mrs. Jameson, in her <i>Legends of the Monastic Orders</i>,
  has left unnoticed the very remarkable book of the <i>Conformity of St.
  Francis's Life with that of Jesus Christ</i>, a work, the blasphemy of
  which is only equalled by its absurdity.</p>

  <p>The book was written by Bartholomew of Pisa, a monk of the order, and
  licensed in 1399 by the general of the Minorites.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Approbatum est a fr. Henrico ord. frat. Minorum generali ministro et

  <p>The third edition, also in folio, appeared at Bologne (1590) as "Liber

</blockquote>

  <p>Another edition, by Jer. Bacch, in folio, appeared at Bologne in 1620;
  and an abridged edition in octavo, by Phil. Bosquier, at Cologne, under
  the title of <i>Antiquitates Franciscanæ</i>, a very good edition of the
  <i>Liber Conform.</i>, "Et ex Annalibus Madingi collecta per Tibur.
  Navarrum," was published in 4to. at Rome in 1670.</p>

  <p>The late Dr. Elrington had a very fine copy of the following French
  translation:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Traite des Conformités du Disciple avec son Maitre, c'est à dire, de

  4to."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In 1542 a small volume was put forth, containing choice passages from
  the <i>Liber Conformitatum</i>, with a preface and letter to the reader,
  purporting to be from Martin Luther. It was accordingly by many
  attributed to him; the real compiler was Erasmus Alberus. The title of
  the first edition is</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Alcoranus Franciscorum, etc., ex libro conformitatum: Francof. 1542,
  parv. 8vo."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It was reprinted, with a French translation, by Conrad Badius, at
  Geneva, 1560 or 1578; so says Brunet.</p>

  <p>The best edition of this work was that published at Amsterdam in 1734,
  in two vols. 12 mo., with some capital plates by Picart. The title
  is&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>Thomas of Celano, the friend and scholar of St. Francis, and the
  author of the famous <i>Dies Iræ</i>, after the saint's death composed a
  brief account of his life, which he afterwards greatly enlarged, and
  which even now is the most authentic we possess. I should be glad to know
  the best, as well as the latest editions of this life.</p>

  <p>"Francis," said Luther, "was no doubt an honest and just man. He
  little thought that such superstition and unbelief should proceed out of
  his life."&mdash;<i>Tischreden.</i></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Berington says of St. Francis:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In an age of less intemperance in religion, miracles and the fancied
  intervention of peculiar favours from heaven, would not have been deemed
  necessary to stamp worth and admiration on a character which in itself
  possessed the purest excellences that fall to the lot of man. But this
  circumstance, and more than this, the reception which an institute so
  peculiarly framed met with, serve to manifest the singular taste of the
  age."&mdash;<i>Berington's Henry II.</i>, p. 629.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>"It is scarcely possible," says Mr. Massingberd, "to read the history
  of St. Francis of Assisi, without believing that there was in him a
  sincere and self-devoted, however ill-directed, piety." We must not let
  the foolish legends afterwards written of him lower him in our
  estimation, nor cease to regard him as a sincere and devoted
  Christian.</p>

  <p><i>M. or N.</i> (Vol. i., p. 415.; Vol. ii., p. 61.).&mdash;There have
  been several suggestions as to the origin of the use of these letters in
  the services of the church, but I do not think that any correspondent has
  hit upon the very simple one which I have always considered to be most
  probably the true explanation; which is, that as these services were
  compiled when algebra stood much higher in the rank of sciences than it
  does at present, it is by no means unlikely that these two letters should
  be used to signify indefinite and variable <i>names</i>, as they are in
  algebra to represent indefinite or variable <i>numbers</i>, in the same
  manner as A.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;C. are as signs of known or definite, and X.&nbsp;Y.&nbsp;Z. of
  unknown sums.</p>

  <p><i>Henry VIII. and Sir Thos. Curwen.</i>&mdash;The following quaint
  extract from Sandford's MS. <i>History of Cumberland</i>, now in the
  library of the Dean and Chapter of Carlisle, exhibits that "reknowned
  king," Henry VIII., in so good-natured a light, that I think, if you can
  find a corner for it, it may amuse some of your readers. That the good
  knight and "excelent archer" should have been so outwitted by his
  son-in-law is a matter of some regret to one of his
  descendants:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Sir Thos. Curwen, Knight, in Henry the Eight's time, an excelent
  archer at twelvescore merks; and went up with his men to shoote with that
  reknowned King at the dissolution of abbeys: and the King says to him,
  Curwen, why doth thee begg none of these Abbeys? I wold gratify thee some
  way. Quoth the other, Thank yow, and afterward said he wold desire of him
  the Abbie of ffurness (nye unto him) for 20<sup>ty</sup> one yeares.
  Sayes the King: take it for ever: quoth the other, it is long enough, for
  youle set them up againe in that time: but they not likely to be set up
  againe, this Sir Tho. Curwen sent Mr. Preston, who had married his
  daughter, to renew the lease for him; and he even rennewed in his own
  name; which when his father-in-law questioned, quoth Mr. Preston, you
  shall have it as long as you live; and I think I may as well have it with
  your daughter as another."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>After some descents, this family of Preston, of the manor of Furness,
  terminated in a daughter, who married Sir William Lowther, whose grandson
  left his estates in Furness and Cartmell to his cousin, Lord George
  Cavendish, through whom they are inherited by the Earl of Burlington. As
  Harry the Eighth's good intentions towards Sir Thomas Curwen have been
  frustrated, his descendants must console themselves by knowing that the
  glorious old ruin of Furness could not be in better hands than his
  lordship's.</p>

  rarity: there is not a copy of it in the Library of Trinity College, or
  in any of the other public libraries of this city [Dublin], which have
  been searched on purpose. The profoundly-learned Vice-Provost, Doctor
  Barrett, never met with one; and many gentlemen well skilled in the
  literature of Ireland, who have been applied to for information on the
  subject, are even unacquainted with the name of the book."</p>

  <p>The full title of the work to which I refer, and which is an 8vo.
  volume of 200 or 300 pages, is <i>Reflections and Resolutions proper for
  the Gentlemen of Ireland, as to their Conduct for the Service of their
  Country</i>. It was printed in Dublin in 1738; it was reprinted there in
  1816 at the sole expense of the well-known philanthropist, Thomas
  Pleasants, and the author was Samuel Madden, D.D., the author of several
  publications: a great patron of arts and literature in his native land,
  and one of whom Dr. Johnson remarked with truth,&mdash;"His was a name
  Ireland ought to honour." For some authentic information respecting him,
  see Nichols's <i>Literary Anecdotes of the Eighteenth Century</i>, vol.
  ii. pp. 31. 699.; and Grosley's <i>Tour in England</i>, vol. ii p. 260.
  These writers, however, make no mention of his <i>Reflections</i>.</p>

  <p>The original edition may indeed be looked upon as rather rare, but not
  so rare as some appear inclined to think. I have a copy, and until lately
  had two; and at different times I have met with copies for sale. However,
  the copy now in the library of the Royal Dublin Society was purchased
  some years ago at a high price; and, unless I am mistaken, there is not
  one as yet in the British Museum. The reprint which is there is much to
  be preferred by readers in general.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>THE BELLMAN, AND HIS HISTORY.</h3>

  <p>I have often read Vincent Bourne's poem, "Ad Davidem Cook,
  Westmonasterii Custodem Nocturnum et Vigilantissimum, Anno 1716:"
  Pickering's edition, p. 129. This nightly guardian, it appears, was
  accompanied by a dog:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Cùm variis implent tenebræ terroribus orbem,</p>
      <p class="i1">Tu comite assuetum cum cane carpis iter,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>was armed with a stout staff, or knotty club:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Nec te perterrent, nodoso stipite fretum,</p>
      <p class="i1">Subdola qui tacito pectore furta parant,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>and carried a bell:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Tinnitu adventum signans, oriantur an astra,</p>
      <p class="i1">Narras, an purè lucida Luna micet."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To the last-mentioned part of his equipment, he owed the title of
  "Bellman."</p>

  <p>The Bellman's duty, however, was not confined to crying the rising of
  the stars, or the shining of the moon, but he cheered his nightly round
  with many a chant:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Nocturnum multo carmine fallis iter."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The next lines are descriptive of the Bellman's poetry, and tell us
  the subjects of it. Of some of these I want explanation; and of all,
  examples. I am at a loss to explain the following four lines:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Divorum hyberni menses quotcunque celebrant,</p>
      <p class="i1">Cuique locum et versum dat tua musa suum:</p>
      <p><i>Crispino</i> ante omnes; neque enim sine carmine fas est</p>
      <p class="i1">Nobile sutorum præteriisse decus."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The next lines refer to the Bellman's loyalty in ever remembering the
  Royal Family; to his salutation of masters and mistresses; to the useful
  instruction he pours forth in song to young men and maidens; and to the
  happy marriages he wishes to such as give heed to his warnings. The
  Bellman then addresses himself to men-servants and maid-servants,
  enjoining honesty on the former, cleanliness on the latter. Repeatedly
  wishing prosperity to his masters, he concludes with one pre-eminent
  exhortation to keep in mind, that the friendly hand of death levels the
  highest and the lowest.</p>

  <p>My ignorance asks several questions. When did the Bellman lay aside
  his bell, and assume the rattle; and, with this change (I presume), drop
  the name of Bellman for that of Watchman, to whom the silent policeman
  has succeeded? Was the dog the usual aide-de-camp of the Bellman? Are
  there any other instances in which the dog is mentioned as assisting the
  Bellman in his nocturnal guardianship?</p>

  <p>As to the Bellman's poetry, Milton will occur to every one:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Or the bellman's drowsy charm</p>
      <p>To bless the door from nightly harm."&mdash;<i>Il Penseroso.</i></p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>1. Herrick's <i>Hesperides</i>, p. 169., is a Bellman's song, a
  blessing, concluding:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Past one o'clock, and almost two,</p>
      <p>My masters all, good-day to you."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>2. Ibid. p. 251. is another song; a warning to remember the
  judgment-day, and ending&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Ponder this when I am gone,</p>
      <p>By the clock 'tis almost one."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>See <i>The Tatler</i>, No. 111., for the Bellman's salutation:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Good morrow, Mr. Bickerstaff, good morrow, my masters
  all.</i>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,</p>
      <p>Which gives the stern'st good night."&mdash;Shakspeare, <i>Macbeth</i>, Act II. Sc. 2.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Gay refers to the Bellman's song in the following lines:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Behold that narrow street which steep descends,</p>
      <p>Whose building to the slimy shore extends;</p>
<!-- Page 325 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page325"></a>{325}</span>
      <p>Here Arundel's fam'd structure rear'd its frame,</p>
      <p>The street alone retains the empty name;</p>
      <p>Where Titian's glowing paint the canvass warm'd,</p>
      <p>And Raphael's fair design, with judgment, charm'd,</p>
      <p>Now hangs <i>the bellman's song</i>, and pasted here</p>
      <p>The colour'd prints of Overton appear."&mdash;<i>Trivia</i>, book ii. 482.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>In the <i>Archaic and Provincial Dictionary</i>, the duty of the
  Bellman in his poetic character seems to be limited to blessing the
  sleepers. It appears from the poem by Vincent Bourne, that his Muse took
  a much more extensive range.</p>

  <p>Can you inform me where I can find more about the Bellman, his bell
  and his dog; and, especially, his songs? Where can I find "The Bellman's
  Songs?"</p>

  <p>Is "Bellman" a name given to dogs in modern times? See <i>Taming of
  the Shrew</i>, Induction.</p>

<h3>WAS SALLUSTIUS A LECTURER?&mdash;CONNEXION
BETWEEN SALLUSTIUS AND TACITUS.</h3>

  <p>Sallustius, in his celebrated abstract of the Punic records of
  Thempsal, makes the following remark:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Nam de Carthagine silere melius puto, quam parum dicere, <i>quoniam
  alio properare tempus monet</i>."&mdash;<i>De Bello Jugurthino</i>, c.
  xix. ed. Allen.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Does not this sound as if the history has been read out to an
  assembly? There is strong presumptive evidence in favour of such a
  supposition, in the tradition of Herodotus having read aloud his history
  at the Grecian Games. Besides, it was a common practice of Cicero and
  Plinius the Younger to read out their orations and treatises. I cannot
  help thinking that the histories of Sallustius were first delivered as
  lectures, <i>taken down by reporters</i><a name="footnotetag2"
  href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> employed by himself for the purposes
  of preserving his words, as he had only notes before him, fairly
  transcribed from the stenographic character, and then, <i>but not till
  then</i>, made a subject of closet-study. This, I think, is easy of
  proof, and instances may be adduced (the expression I have quoted is one)
  where the lecturer peeps out.</p>

  <p>The interpolated state in which this classic has come down to us is
  indeed sad: there is scarcely a chapter throughout the Catiline and
  Jugurtha where some transcriber has not been at work, sticking in words
  and sometimes whole sentences, which, I am astonished to see, have
  escaped the notice of Cortius, Allen, and the older editors.</p>

  <p>I said above that Sallustius made his lectures or orations on the
  history of his country a subject of closet study. He did so, and in an
  eminent degree. His conciseness, clearness (when relieved from the burden
  of interpolation), and usual impartiality, point to a careful and
  spiritual study of Thucydides; but he could not attain to an equal degree
  of sweetness as the Greek historian, on account of the general character
  of their several languages differing. As far, however, as Roman could
  approach to Greek, I conceive Sallustius has approached to Thucydides.
  Tacitus (whose mind was impregnated with, and steeped in Sallustius)
  rarely enounces a sentiment in his numerous works the origin of which is
  not referable to the latter author. It requires some careful thought
  sometimes, before the passages can be traced; but they <i>are</i>
  traceable; and if we had the whole works of Sallustius, I doubt not but
  that we should be able to trace them all much more easily.
  Perhaps&mdash;I say it without stress, mind; it is a mere
  suggestion&mdash;it would be possible to restore, or rather connect some
  of the historical fragments of Sallustius by means of the works of
  Tacitus. When we find a sentiment of Sallustius half expressed in the
  fragment, and trending towards the conclusion arrived at by Tacitus, may
  we not, as we know how completely the latter had imbibed the thoughts of
  the former, reasonably suppose the remainder of the passage to be
  parallel; and, following out the idea, restore it, taking into
  consideration the difference of the mode of expression in the two eras?
  And this may hold good, not only between Tacitus and Sallustius, but
  between Sallustius and Thucydides.</p>

  <p>Such is the aspect under which I endeavour to behold the classics,
  viz. as one great whole, having here and there pieces gone or faded (lost
  or hopelessly corrupted), and which fit into each other, showing the
  building which intellect erects, the only building calculated to
  withstand the hand of time. Thanks be to printing, to cheap literature,
  and to English energy and investigation, antiquity may again rear her
  head, and fell that it is comprehended in all its varied bearings, and
  lights and shadows.</p>

  <p>To men like Niebuhr, Grote, Layard, Prescott, St. John, Wilkinson,
  Rawlinson, and Norris, do we owe a debt of gratitude, for such patience
  and investigation; and no one cheers them on with a more sincere feeling,
  and thanks them for their past exertions, than</p>

<h3>THE OUTER TEMPLE.</h3>

  <p>Mr. Peter Cunningham, in his delightful <i>Handbook of London</i>,
  says that when the New Temple "passed to the Knights of St. John of
  Jerusalem, the Inner and Middle Temple were leased to the Students of the
  Common Law; and the <span class="sc">Outer Temple</span> to Walter
  Stapleton, Bishop of Exeter:" and in describing Essex House, by which
  name it <!-- Page 326 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page326"></a>{326}</span>was afterwards known, he repeats the same
  statement; as if the Outer Temple was part of the original property of
  the Knights Templars.</p>

  <p>I should be very glad to know what authority he has for this; because
  I have very great doubt whether the "Outer Temple" ever belonged to the
  Knights Templars or to the Knights of St. John, or was in any manner
  comprehended within the property. The New Temple, as the whole property
  was called, belonged to Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, at the time
  of his death, in June, 1323. The Council of Vienna, in 1324, bestowed all
  the lands of the Knights Templars on the Knights of St. John. Since my
  letter to you on the general subject of the Temple, and L.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;L.'s
  obliging answer (Vol. ii., pp. 103. 123.), I have been kindly furnished
  by Mr. Joseph Burtt, of the Chapter House, with a deed, dated June 28,
  1324, by which the Knights of St. John granted the <i>whole</i> of the
  New Temple, "totum messuagium nostrum vocatum Novum Templum," to Hugh le
  Despencer the younger; describing it to be lying <i>between the house</i>
  (hospicium) <i>of the Bishop of Exeter</i> towards the west, and the
  house of Hugo de Courteneye towards the east. This shows manifestly that
  if the Bishop of Exeter's house ever belonged to the Temple, it did not
  at that time; and I am not aware of any earlier evidence proving that the
  Templars ever possessed it.</p>

  <p>I believe, though I have not seen the record, that, in the grant to
  Sir William Paget, temp. Henry VI., it is described as the "Outer
  Temple;" but I am inclined to think, from various circumstantial
  testimonies, that it was merely so called because it was situate on the
  <i>outside</i> of the Temple.</p>

  <p>If any of your correspondents could illustrate this question, or that
  more curious one,&mdash;when the new Temple was first divided between
  Inner and Middle,&mdash;I should feel infinitely obliged.</p>

  which I find recorded in a catalogue thus:&mdash;<i>A Catalogue of above
  300 Coins of Canute, King of Denmark and England, found near Kirkwall,

<h3>DUTCH BOOKS PUBLISHED OUT OF THE NETHERLANDS.</h3>

  <p>Although the Dutch language is now regarded in foreign countries with
  a neglect bordering on contempt, and its study, when attended to at all,
  generally undertaken as a work of necessity rather than a labour of love,
  I have thought it would not be without interest to examine to what extent
  it was formerly cultivated (were it even chiefly by Dutchmen) in foreign
  lands; to institute a search after the productions of the Dutch mind in
  the Dutch language brought forth on foreign soils; in a word, to pass in
  review the Dutch books which have been published in other countries
  during the period included between the invention of printing and our own
  days.</p>

  <p>It appears to me that such a review would lead to much interesting
  research, and would tend not only to illustrate our literature, but also
  to clear up many points still obscure in our national, and more
  especially in our ecclesiastical, history.</p>

  <p>The review which I propose would be limited, in the first instance, to
  the formation of an exact and complete list of such <i>exotic</i> works,
  with the addition of such notes as I might be able to add. A more
  experienced hand may then make use of these materials to form a more
  perfect treatise on this portion of our literature.</p>

  <p>In execution of this plan I have already compiled a list of names of
  books and authors; these have been gathered partly from an examination of
  the works themselves, partly from catalogues and other sources where such
  works are mentioned. Now, however, as my resources are nearly exhausted,
  and my labours by no means complete, I take the liberty to lay my plan
  before those who may be disposed to concur with me, those who may be able
  to procure me information, those who have the possession or the care of
  libraries in which such books are to be found, and of which catalogues
  have not been printed; and, for the end I have in view, I invite them all
  to help me in the completion of my work. The editors of the
  <i>Navorscher</i> have consented to open their columns to contributors.
  To spare needless trouble, I wish it to be distinctly understood that I
  do not include any works published in <i>Belgium</i>, or in the colonies
  now or formerly in our possession.</p>

<h3>WHAT WAS THE COUNTRY OF THE ANGLES?</h3>

  <p>What country was inhabited by the Angles before they occupied Britain?
  Adam of Bremen (<i>Hist. Eccl.</i> c. 3.) says:</p>

  <p>"Igitur Saxones primo circa Rhenum sedes habitant et vocati sunt Angli
  quorum pars inde veniens in Britanniam, etc."</p>

</blockquote>

<p><!-- Page 327 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page327"></a>{327}</span></p>

  <p>Notwithstanding the opinion of Turner, and most other historians, I
  venture to offer a few facts in confirmation of the monk's testimony. 1.
  The names of places on the Lower Rhine, and more especially in
  Guelderland, point to an <i>Anglian</i> origin for instance,
  <i>Engelanderholt</i>, <i>Engelenburg</i> and <i>Engelenberg</i>,
  <i>Angerlo</i> olim <i>Angelerlo</i>. <i>Engeland</i>, near Beekbergen,
  is mentioned in a charter<a name="footnotetag3"
  href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> dated 801 as <i>villa Englandi</i>.
  Several other places bear the same name: two near Hardenberg, one in the
  land of Putten, another in our parish; which also contains
  <i>Henschoten</i> olim <i>Hengestschoten</i>, and owes its own name to
  <i>Woden</i>. Near Nimwegen, we have <i>Horssen</i>. 2. Many local names
  in the same district, which can only be explained by reference to the
  A.-S. <i>Hulkestein</i> on the Zuyder Sea, <i>Hulkestein</i> near Arnhem,
  from A.-S. <i>hulc</i>, a dwelling: thus, stone buildings, castles.
  <i>Thri</i>, A.-S., three, is mentioned in a charter dated 855 as the
  name of a villa, now the hamlet <i>Drie</i>, near Ermelo. <i>Hierd</i>
  and <i>Heerd</i>, from A.-S. <i>hierde</i>, perhaps also <i>Hardewick</i>
  or <i>Harderwyk</i> from the same. <i>Braclog</i>, a wood near
  Engelanderholt, from <i>brac</i>, enemy, and <i>locen</i>, an enclosure,
  is mentioned in a charter (801). <i>Luntern</i> and <i>Lunhorst</i>, from
  A.-S. <i>Lun</i>, poor. <i>Wigmond</i>, from <i>wig</i>, war; and
  <i>mund</i>, defence. <i>Culenburg</i>, from <i>ciol</i> or <i>ceol</i>,
  a ship. <i>Klingelbeck</i>, near Arnhem, from <i>clingan</i>, to shrink

  <i>here</i> and <i>win</i>. 3. The agreement between the names of places
  here, and those of every part of England occupied by the Angles. Out of a
  great number of instances collected by Mr. Molhuysen (see Nyhoff's
  <i>Bijdragen</i>, vol. iii.) I will take a few. In Kent we have
  Appledore, Appleton, Appleby; here <i>Appeldorn</i>, <i>Appel</i>,
  <i>Appeltern</i>, <i>Appelenburg</i> on the Wahal. Ashe and Ash;
  <i>Asch</i>, near Buren, and others. Barne; <i>Bern</i> near Heusden, and
  <i>Baarn</i> near Amersfoort. Barnefield; <i>Barneveld</i>. Bonington,
  <i>Boningen</i>. Dover; <i>Doveren</i>. Gillingham; <i>Gellinchem</i>.
  Hearne; <i>Hiern</i>, near Waardenburg. Herne; <i>Hernen</i>. Leisdon;
  <i>Leusden</i>. Lone; <i>Loenen</i>. Sandwich; <i>Sandwyk</i>, near Tiel.
  Watchorne; <i>Waghorn</i>, in the Velume. In Yorkshire: Beel; <i>De
  Beele</i>, near Voorst. Byland; <i>Byland</i>. Campe; <i>Campen</i>.
  Catwich; <i>Katwyk</i>. Dodworth; <i>Dodewaard</i>. Ecope; <i>Heicop</i>.
  Grimestone; <i>Grimmestein</i>, on the Eem. Heck; <i>Eck</i>. Hampall;
  <i>Empel</i>, near Engelen. Herfield; <i>Herveld</i>. Hewick;
  <i>Ewyk</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;The evident similarity of names in
  this list, which might be extended through several pages, affords at
  least a strong presumption that a part of the land of our fathers is to
  be sought here. I will just add that there is a MS. containing copies of
  charters, registers, &amp;c., collected by Opstraeten van der Moelen, a
  genealogist, who died in the early part of the seventeenth century, now
  in the possession of Mr. Van Asch van Wyck. In this is an article
  entitled "De Nobili et Antiqua Familia dicta Amersfoort seu potius
  Heemsfurt vel Hemefurt a vado Heeme seu Hemi fluvii." The writer makes
  mention of the well-known grant of Charlemagne to the cathedral of
  Utrecht, by which Lisidunum (Leusden) and four forests on the banks of
  the Eem were ceded to this church: <i>Hengestschoten</i>, <i>Fornese</i>,
  <i>Mocoroth</i>, and <i>Widoc</i>. The writer considers the last-named
  forest to be that of <i>Wede</i> or <i>Woden</i>; and derives thence the
  family-name <i>Weede</i>. Concerning <i>Hengestschoten</i> is
  remarked:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Hengist</i>, qui circum annum 450 Britanniam insulam cum suis
  Frisonibus et Saxonibus occupat." And further: "Weede nomen adhunc
  retinere videtur a <i>Woden</i>, qui fuit avus avi <i>Hengesti</i>, sicut
  <i>Hengestschoten</i>, nune prædium dominorum Oestbroek, ab
  <i>Hengisto</i> nominatur."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Henschoten was ceded to the abbey of Oestbroek in 1130, and sold at
  the breaking up of the monasteries; and is now the property of Mr. Van
  Asch van Wyck. Since, therefore, the above extract must have been written
  before the Reformation, the belief that our forefathers proceeded from
  this country is by no means new; and the evidence in its support is, I
  think, stronger than that adduced by Turner and Lappenberg in favour of
  an immigration from Sleswig; indeed it seems not improbable that the
  first settlers, with <i>Hengist</i> at their head, sailed from the mouth
  of the Eem. I have more to add in a future Number, if "<span

<h2>Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Villenage.</i>&mdash;Can any of your readers inform me at what
  period villenage became extinct in this kingdom? I have now before me a
  grant of a manor from the Crown, in the third and fourth year of the
  reigns of King Philip and Queen Mary, conveying, amongst other goods and
  chattels, the bondmen, bondwomen, and villeins, with their
  sequels,&mdash;"Nativos, nativas, e villanos cum eoz sequelis." According
  to Blackstone, the children of villeins were in the same state of bondage
  with their parents; whence they were called, in Latin, "nativi," which
  gave rise to the female appellation of a villein, who was called a
  <i>neife</i>. What I wish to learn is, whether the old wording of Crown
  grants had survived the <!-- Page 328 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page328"></a>{328}</span>existence of villenage; or whether bondage
  was a reality in the reign of Philip and Mary; and if so, at what it
  became extinct?</p>

  <p><i>Roman Roads near London.</i>&mdash;In the most ancient maps of
  Middlesex that I have seen, there are no roads marked out. In a folio
  coloured map of Middlesex, published by Bowen (the date of which is, I
  think, 1709, although the same map has various dates, like those of
  Speed, where the date only is altered several times), the roads are
  introduced. A Roman road appears from the corner of the Tottenham Court
  Road, where the Hampstead Road and the New Road now meet, running through
  what must now be the Regent's Park, until it reaches Edgeware, and thence
  to Brockley Hills, called Sulloniacæ, an ancient city in Antonine's
  <i>Itinerary</i>. The lanes marking this road are so different from the
  other roads, as to show at once what is intended; and yet, either in this
  same map or in another with the same route, Watling Street is printed
  upon the highway that leads to Tyburn Turnpike, in a manner to show the
  whole of that distance is meant. The Roman road from Tottenham Court,
  after making its appearance in a variety of other maps up to a certain
  date, about 1780, is nowhere to be found since, in any of the Middlesex
  maps. Can any of your readers show by what authority this was first
  introduced, and why discontinued; and if the Watling Street branched off,
  upon its approach to London, where did the part crossing Oxford Street at
  Tyburn lead to?</p>

  <p><i>University Hoods.</i>&mdash;The Scotch universities of Aberdeen,

  to determine; but this much is known, that the hoods of Aberdeen were
  identical with those of Paris, those of St. Andrew's with those of
  Louvain, and those of Glasgow with those of Bologna. The Revolution,
  however, has done much to obliterate the traces of even the Parisian
  hoods, and the M.A. hood of Paris is all that has hitherto rewarded the
  researches of the university antiquary. Can any of your readers assist in
  the somewhat interesting investigation by endeavouring to discover, or

<h2>Minor Queries Answered.</h2>

  <p><i>Wither's Haleluiah.</i>&mdash;Mr. R. A. Willmott, in his <i>Lives

  Wither, and vindicating his claims as poet, whom it has long been the
  fashion to underrate, but who Southey said "had the heart and soul of a
  poet in him."&mdash;(<i>Life</i>, iii. 126.)</p>

  <p>In the <i>Life</i>, Mr. Willmott says:</p>

  <p><i>Apple-pie Order.</i>&mdash;<i>Spick and Span new.</i>&mdash;My wife

  <p>1. What is the origin of the phrase "Apple-pie order?"</p>

  <p>2. Ditto&mdash;of "Spick and span new?"</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Jerry Sneak</span>.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[We leave to some of our friends the task of answering the first of
  the Queries which our correspondent has put to us by desire of his
  "better-half."</p>

  <p>There is much curious illustration of the phrase <i>Spick and Span</i>
  in Todd's <i>Johnson</i>, s. v. <i>Spick</i>: and Nares in his
  <i>Glossary</i> says, "<i>Span-newe</i> is found in Chaucer:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'This tale was aie <i>span-newe</i> to begin.'&mdash;<i>Troil. and Cres.</i>, iii. 1671.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It is therefore of good antiquity in the language, and not having been
  taken from the French may best be referred to the Saxon, in which
  <i>spannan</i> means to stretch. Hence <i>span-new</i> is fresh from the
  <i>stretchers</i>, or frames, alluding to cloth, a very old manufacture
  of the country; and <i>spick</i> and <i>span</i> is fresh from the spike,
  or tenter, and frames. This is Johnson's derivation, and I cannot but
  think it preferable to any other."</p>

  <p>A very early instance of the expression, not quoted by Todd, may be
  found in the <i>Romance of Alexander</i>: <!-- Page 331 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page331"></a>{331}</span></p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Richelich he doth him schrede</p>
      <p>In <i>spon-neowe</i> knightis weode."&mdash;L. 4054-5.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>And <i>Weber</i>, in his <i>Glossary</i> (or rather, Mr. Douce, for
  the "D" appended to the note shows it to have proceeded from that
  accomplished antiquary), explains it, "<i>Spon-neowe</i>, span-new, newly
  spun. This is probably the true explanation of spick and span new. Ihre
  renders sping-spang, <i>plane novus</i>, in voce fick fack." The learned
  Jamieson, in his <i>Dictionary</i>, s. v. <i>Split-new</i> (which
  corresponds to the German <i>Splitter neu</i>, i. e. as new as a splinter
  or chip from the block), shows, at greater length than we can quote, that
  <i>split</i> and <i>span</i> equally denote a splinter or chip; and in
  his <i>Supplement</i>, s. v. <i>Spang-new</i>, after pointing out the
  connexion between <i>spinga</i> (assula) and <i>spaungha</i> (lamina),

<h3>HAYBANDS IN SEALS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., pp. 186. 248. 291.)</p>

  <p>I am sorry that in referring to a peculiarity in ancient seals under
  this title, <span class="sc">Mr. Lower</span> should have pinned to his
  notice a theory which I feel persuaded is quite untenable. It is surely
  something new to those who have directed their attention to the numerous
  devices upon seals to find that the husbandman had so low an opinion of
  his own social status as to reject the use of any emblematical sign upon
  his seal, when Thomas the smith, Roger the carpenter, and William the
  farrier, bore the elements of their respective crafts as proudly as the
  knight did his chevron or fess. But the question is one of facts. The
  following examples of the use of the "hayband" are now before
  me:&mdash;</p>

  <p>6 June, 7 Henry IV. Grant by John Dursley, citizen and armorer of
  London, to William Serjaunt Taverner, of Stanes, and another, of a
  messuage, &amp;c. in Westminster. Seal of dark red was, about 1½ inch in
  diameter; a hay-stalk twisted and pressed into the wax while hot,
  inclosing a space as large as a shilling, in which is a poor impression
  of a badly engraved seal; the whole very clumsy and rough.</p>

  <p>26 November, 24 Henry VI. Grant by Maurice Brune, Knight, Robert
  Darcy, John Doreward, Henry Clovill, Esquire, John Grene, and Henry
  Stampe, to Richard Hill and others, of lands, &amp;c., in Sprinfield,
  &amp;c., in Essex. Each seal is round and thick, and has the impression
  of a small armorial bearing. The 1st, 2nd, and 5th seals have a small
  plaited coil of hay pressed into the wax, and inclosing the
  impression.</p>

  <p>26 Henry VI. Receipt by Jane Grene for 10<i>l.</i> paid her by the
  Earl of Ormond. Seal of diminutive size, and the impression nearly
  defaced. Round the extreme edge is a "diminutive hayband."</p>

  <p>2 January, 34 Henry VI. Grant by Thomas Tudenham, Knight, John
  Leventhorp, Esquire, and Thomas Radclyff, of the reversion of the manor
  of Newhall to John Neell and others. All the seals, which are large and
  thick and more than two inches in diameter, have the impression of a
  signet ring inclosed with a "hayband" <i>of parchment</i> pressed into
  them. One of these coils being loose shows itself to be a thin strip of
  the label itself brought through the wax.</p>

  <p>10 February, 14 Edward IV. Lease by Sir Thomas Urswyk, Knight, Chief
  Baron of the Exchequer, and Thomas Lovell, to John Morton and others, of
  the manor of Newhall, Essex, and other lands, &amp;c. The seal of Lovell
  has his armorial bearings and legend; that of the Lord Chief Baron is the
  impression of a signet ring, being a classical bust. The seal itself is a
  thick ball of wax about <!-- Page 332 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page332"></a>{332}</span>two inches across, pressed into the face
  of which is a "hayband" or twisted coil of <i>thin parchment</i>
  inclosing the impression.</p>

  <p>I am sure that I have seen many examples much earlier and later, but
  those given are merely in reference to the theory of your Lewes
  correspondent. Even they are surely inconsistent with the idea of the
  practice being peculiar to any locality or distinctive of any class. My
  recollection would lead me to assign the fourteenth to the sixteenth
  centuries as the period of its use. But still the question
  remains&mdash;Has it any, and what signification? I have always
  considered it to have been a contrivance to strengthen the substance of
  the seal itself. The earliest instances I have seen were "appliqué"
  seals, such as the royal privy seals, and with these it would seem to
  have originated. Their frail nature suggested the use of some substance
  to protect the thin layer of wax from damage by the crumpling of the
  parchment on which they were impressed. For some time its use was
  confined to this kind of seal; and fashion may perhaps have extended the
  practice to pendent seals, where, however, it was often efficacious in
  neutralising the bad quality of the wax so general in the fifteenth and
  sixteenth centuries. The plaiting of the hay or straw sometimes assumed a
  fanciful shape. Although the impressions of seals of the time of Henry
  VII. are often very bad, there are generally traces of their existence;
  these may perhaps be discovered in <span class="sc">Mr. Lower's</span>
  seals if he looks more to the enclosure than to the substance forming
  it.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Joseph Burtt</span>.</p>

  <p><i>Haybands in Seals.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">M.&nbsp;A. Lower</span>
  thinks that <span class="sc">Mr. T. Hudson Turner</span> has misapplied
  his description of the seals in his possession. The seals are not
  <i>impressed upon haybands</i>, neither do "some ends of the hay or straw
  protrude from the surface." The little fillet or wreath of hay, about
  equal in diameter to a shilling, is <i>inlaid</i> upon the pendent lump
  of wax, and forms the ornament or device of the seal, rather than an
  integral portion of it, like that in the specimens referred to by <span
  class="sc">Mr. Turner</span>.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">M. A. Lower</span> begs, under favour, to add, that
  the very fact of a Query being inserted in the pages of this
  invaluable&mdash;one might almost say indispensable&mdash;publication,
  implies a candid avowal <i>pro tanto</i> of ignorance on the part of the
  Querist, who might reasonably expect a plain answer, unaccompanied by any
  ungracious reflection on the side of the more highly-gifted <i>savant</i>
  that furnished the reply. As a simple matter of taste, many other
  correspondents besides <span class="sc">Mark Antony Lower</span> may
  probably object, like the latter's eminent namesake, Mr. Tony Weller, to
  being "pulled up so wery short," especially in cases where there is a
  clear misapprehension on the part of the respondent.</p>

  <p><i>Haybands in Seals.</i>&mdash;It is impossible for one moment to
  doubt the correctness of <span class="sc">Mr. Hudson Turner's</span>
  remarks on this question, and I hasten to retract my own suggestions,
  frankly acknowledging them to be erroneous.</p>

  <p>I had always taken the same view as <span class="sc">Mr. Turner</span>
  (for it is very palpable to the eye, and speaks for itself), till
  diverted from it by one of those sudden fancies which, spite of all
  caution, will ever and anon unaccountably cross the mind and bewilder the
  better judgment. To have established my view, these rushes should have
  been proved to be affixed to deeds of <i>feoffment alone</i>; a point
  which, at the moment, I overlooked. Even while I write, I have before me
  a <i>lease</i> granted by the abbey of Denney in the fifteenth century,
  with a rush in the seal; and <span class="sc">Mr. Turner's</span> cited
  instances of royal charters put an end to all question.</p>

  <p>Lest others be led astray by my freak of fancy, without an opportunity
  of correcting it by <span class="sc">Mr. Turner's</span> statement, the
  proper course for me is to acknowledge myself wrong&mdash;palpably,
  unmistakeably wrong,&mdash;<span class="sc">Mr. Turner's</span>
  explanation is the correct one; thanks to him for it&mdash;<i>liberavi
  animam meam</i>.</p>

<h3>NORTH SIDE OF CHURCHYARDS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ii., pp. 93. 253.; Vol. iii., p. 125.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondents on this subject have generally taken it as
  granted, that the prejudice against burying in this portion of the
  churchyard is almost universal. In a former communication (Vol. ii., p.
  93.) I stated that there are at least some exceptions. Since that time I
  have visited perhaps a hundred churchyards in the counties of York,
  Derby, Stafford, Bucks, Herts, and Oxford, and in nearly half of these
  burial had evidently been long since practised on the north side of the
  several churches. The parish church of Ashby de la Zouch is built so near
  the south wall of the churchyard, that the north must clearly have been
  designed for sepulture. I was incumbent of an ancient village church in
  that neighbourhood, which is built in the same manner, with scarcely any
  ground on the south, the north being large and considerably raised by the
  numerous interments which have taken place in it. It has also some old
  tombs, which ten years ago were fast falling to decay. The part south of
  the church contains very few graves, and all apparently of recent
  date.</p>

  <p>In my former communication I mentioned, that in this churchyard burial
  has been chiefly, till of late, on the north side of the church; and,
  since that communication, a vault has been made on the south side, which
  has convinced us the ground had never before been there broken up. The
  soil is chalk; whereas, whenever a grave is made on the north side, human
  dust and bones are so <!-- Page 333 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page333"></a>{333}</span>abundant, that the chalk soil has almost
  lost its nature.</p>

  <p>Till more light can be thrown on the subject than what has yet
  appeared in "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>," I cannot but
  retain my original opinion, viz., that the favourite part of interment,
  in earlier times, was that nearest the principal entrance into the
  church. The original object of burying in churches and churchyards was
  the better to insure for the dead the prayers of the worshippers, as they
  assembled for public devotion. Hence the churchyard nearest the entrance
  into church would be most in request. The origin of the prejudice for the
  south side, which I believe to be of recent date, may, I doubt not, be
  ascertained from any superstitious cottager who entertains it. "It would
  be so cold, sir," said one to me, "to be always lying where the sun would
  never shine on me."</p>

  <p>If your correspondent on this subject in Vol. iii., p. 125., would ask
  an old inhabitant of his parish which is the <i>backside</i> of their
  church, and why it is so called? he would probably come at the fact. I
  would refer him to Burn's <i>History of Parish Registers</i>, page 96.,
  foot-note, where he will find it stated that "a part of the churchyard
  was sometimes left unconsecrated, for the purpose of burying
  excommunicated persons."</p>

  <p class="address">Drayton Beauchamp.</p>

  <p><i>North Side of Churchyards.</i>&mdash;Your correspondents seem to be
  agreed as to the facts, not as to the origin of the objection. I suspect
  <span class="sc">Mr. Hawker</span> (Vol. ii., p. 253.) is nearest the
  truth; and the following, from <i>Coverdale on Praying for the Dead</i>,
  may help to strengthen his conjecture:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"As men die, so shall they arise: <i>if in faith</i> in the Lord
  <i>towards the south</i>, they need no prayers; they are presently happy,
  and shall arise in glory: <i>if in unbelief</i> without the Lord
  <i>towards the north</i>, then are they past all hope."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p><i>North Side of Churchyards</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 253. 346.).&mdash;The
  subjoined extract from Bishop Wilkins's <i>Discourse concerning a New
  Planet, tending to prove that it is probable our Earth is one of the
  Planets</i>, 8vo., 1640, pp. 64-66., will serve to illustrate the passage
  from Milton, of the north being "the devoted region of Satan and his
  hosts:"</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It was the opinion of the Jewish rabbies, that man was created with
  his face to the east; therefore the Hebrew word signifies <i>ante</i>, or
  the east; <i>post</i>, or the west; <i>dextra</i>, or the south;
  <i>sinistra</i>, or the north. You may see all of them put together in
  that place of Job xxiii. 8, 9.: 'Behold I go forward, and he is not
  there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him: on the left hand, where
  he doth work, but I cannot behold him. He hideth himself on the right
  hand, that I cannot see him.' Which expressions are, by some
  interpreters, referred unto the four coasts of heaven, according to the
  common use of those original words. From hence it is that many of the
  ancients have concluded hell to be in the north, which is signified by
  the left hand; unto which side, our Saviour tells us, that the goats
  shall be divided. Which opinion likewise seems to be favoured by that
  place in Job xxvi. 6, 7., where it is said, "Hell is naked before God,
  and destruction hath no covering.' And presently it is added, 'He
  stretcheth out the north over the empty place.' Upon these grounds, St.
  Jerome interprets that speech of the Preacher, Eccles. xi. 3.: 'If the
  tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the
  tree falleth, there shall it be,' concerning those who shall go either to
  heaven or hell. And in this sense also do some expound that of Zechariah
  (xiv. 4.), where it is said that 'the Mount of Olives shall cleave in the
  midst: half of it shall remove toward the north, and half of it toward
  the south.' By which it is intimated, that amongst those Gentiles, who
  shall take upon them the profession of Christ, there are two sorts: some
  that go to the north, that is, to hell; and others to the south, that is,
  to heaven. And therefore it is, say they, that God so often threatens
  evil out of the north: and upon this ground it is, saith Besoldus, that
  there is no religion that worships that way. We read of the Mahometans,
  that they adore towards the south; the Jews towards the west; Christians
  towards the east; but none to the <i>north</i>."</p>

<h3>THE ROLLIAD, AND SOME OF ITS WRITERS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 276.)</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Mr. Dawson Turner</span> asks for information
  regarding three writers in the <i>Rolliad</i>, viz.: Tickell, Richardson,
  and Fitzpatrick. Memoirs of the first two are given in Chalmers's
  <i>Dictionary</i>; but in Moore's <i>Life of Sheridan</i>, <span
  class="sc">Mr. Turner</span> will find several notices of them, far more
  attractive than dry biographical details. They were both intimately
  associated with Sheridan; Tickell, indeed, was his brother-in-law. One
  would prefer calling them his <i>friends</i>, but steady friendship must
  rest upon a firmer basis than those gifts of wit, talent, and a keen
  sense of the ridiculous, which prevailed so largely amongst this clever
  trio.</p>

  <p>Tickell's production, <i>Anticipation</i>, is still remembered from
  its cleverness and humour; but when every speaker introduced into its
  pages has long been dead, and some of them were little known to fame, the
  pamphlet is preserved by a few solely from the celebrity which it once
  possessed.</p>

  <p>His death in 1793 was a most melancholy one. It is described by
  Professor Smyth in in his interesting <i>Memoir of Sheridan</i>, a book
  printed some years ago for distribution among his friends, and which well
  deserves publication.</p>

  <p>Independent of his contributions to the <i>Rolliad</i>, <!-- Page 334
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page334"></a>{334}</span>Richardson did
  little as an author. His comedy of <i>The Fugitive</i>, acted and
  published in 1792, was well received, and is much praised. Why has this
  production so completely disappeared?</p>

  <p>General Fitzpatrick was born in 1749, and died in 1815. He was the
  second son of John, Earl of Upper Ossory; twice Secretary-at-War; once
  secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the Duke of Portland, but
  what he regarded as his highest distinction, and it is recorded on his
  tomb, was the friendship of Fox during forty years of their lives.</p>

  <p>Some of his speeches on the union with Ireland will be found in the
  thirty-fourth volume of the <i>Parliamentary History</i>.</p>

  <p>His epitaph, by himself, is inscribed on a sarcophagus in the
  church-yard at Sunning Hill, in which he describes himself&mdash;what his
  friends admitted to be truth&mdash;a politician without ambition, a
  writer without vanity.</p>

  <p>Which is the true reading in the following lines by Fitzpatrick on
  Fox? In my copy the word "course" in the third line is erased, and the
  word "mind" is substituted.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"A patriot's even course he steered,</p>
      <p>Mid Faction's wildest storms unmoved:</p>
      <p>By all who marked his <i>course</i> revered,</p>
      <p>By all who knew his heart beloved."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Sheridan says most justly:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Wit being generally founded upon the manners and characters of its
  own day, is crowned in that day, beyond all other exertions of the mind,
  with splendid and immediate success. But there is always something that
  equalises. In return, more than any other production, it suffers suddenly
  and irretrievably from the hand of Time."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Still some publications, from their wit and brilliancy, are
  sufficiently buoyant to float down to posterity. The publication in
  question, the <i>Rolliad</i>, is one; the <i>Anti-Jacobin</i> another.
  You may not be unwilling, in your useful pages, to give a list of some of
  the writers in the latter publication. My own copy of it is marked from
  that belonging to one of the writers, and is as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>Nos. 1. 4. 9. 19. 26, 27&mdash;33., by Mr George Ellis.</p>
      <p>Nos. 6. and 7., by Messrs. Ellis and Frere.</p>
      <p>Nos. 20, 21, 22. 30&mdash;36., by Mr. Canning.</p>
      <p>No. 10. by M.; No. 13. by C. B.; No. 39. by N.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>To the remaining numbers, neither names nor initials are affixed. Can
  any of your readers explain the initials, M., C.&nbsp;B., and N., and give us
  the authors of the <i>remaining</i> numbers?</p>

  <p>In replying to Mr. <span class="sc">Turner's</span> Queries, I shall
  attend to the wish expressed by so old and so valued a friend, and
  substitute for initials, of which he disapproves, the name of</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. H. Markland</span>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<h3>RICHARDSON&mdash;TICKELL&mdash;FITZPATRICK.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 276.)</p>

  <p>I am much surprised at <span class="sc">Mr. Dawson Turner's</span>
  inquiry about these names. I will not say with him that, "not to know
  them argues himself unknown." On the contrary, my wonder is, that one,
  himself so well and so favourably known as <span class="sc">Mr.
  Turner</span>, should have need to ask such a question about men with
  whom, or, at least, with whose fame, he must have been a contemporary,
  presuming, as I do, that he is the same <span class="sc">Mr. Dawson
  Turner</span> with whose works we have been acquainted for above half a
  century. Since, however, he has made the Query, I will answer it as
  succinctly as I can.</p>

  <p>The Right Honourable Richard Fitzpatrick was the only brother of the
  last Earl of Upper Ossory, and prominent in fashion, in politics, and in
  elegant literature, and not undistinguished as a soldier. He sat in
  <i>nine</i> successive parliaments (in two which I knew him). As early as
  1782 he was Secretary for Ireland, and in 1783 Secretary-at-War, which
  office he again filled in 1806. In the galaxy of opposition wits, when
  opposition was wittiest, Fitzpatrick was generally admitted to be the
  first, and there were those who thought him <i>in general powers</i>
  superior even to Fox and Sheridan. His oratory, however, did not do
  justice to his talents, and he was both shy and indolent. His best speech
  was that in December, 1796, for the release of Lafayette, to which even
  the ridicule of the <i>Anti-Jacobin</i> allowed the merit of pathetic
  eloquence. His share in the <i>Rolliad</i> was considerable, and there
  are many other sprightly and some elegant specimens of his poetical
  talents scattered through various publications. I wish they were
  collected.</p>

  <p>Richard Tickell, the grandson of Addison's friend, and brother-in-law
  to Sheridan, was the author of <i>Anticipation</i>, one of the liveliest
  political pamphlets ever written. He published many occasional poems, the
  best of which is a poetical "Epistle from Charles Fox, partridge
  shooting, to Lord John Townsend, cruising." <span class="sc">Mr. Dawson
  Turner</span> will find more about him in the <i>Biographical
  Dictionary</i>.</p>

  <p>Joseph Richardson, who died in 1803, was M.P. for Newport in three
  parliaments. He was an intimate friend of Sheridan's, and partner with
  him in Drury Lane Theatre. He wrote a play, entitled <i>The Fugitive</i>;
  but he is only remembered for his contributions (whatever they were) to
  the <i>Rolliad</i>. In the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> (vol. lxxiii. p.
  602.), <span class="sc">Mr. Dawson Turner</span> will find a longer
  notice of him.</p>

  <p>There are a few remarks on the authors of the <i>Rolliad</i> in
  Moore's <i>Life of Sheridan</i>, i. 420.</p>

<h3>QUAKERS' ATTEMPT TO CONVERT THE POPE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 302.)</p>

  <p>I have never met with any satisfactory account of this singular Quaker
  aggression. Perhaps it may be a contribution towards one if you can find
  room for some notice of a tract in my possession. It is entitled, <i>A
  Narrative of some of the Sufferings of J.&nbsp;P. in the City of Rome. London,
  printed for Thomas Simmons, at the Bull and Mouth, near Aldersgate</i>,
  1661, 4to., pp. 16. This narrative of John Perrot's does not, however,
  give any particulars respecting his going to Rome, or the proceedings
  which led to his captivity there, but begins with the words&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"When I was cast into Prison, because I loved the souls of my
  enemies," &amp;c.;</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>and after eight pages, chiefly occupied by inflated description of his
  sorrows, from which one obtains no facts, he tells us that God took pity
  on him,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"And raised up his little babe, my dear Brother Thomas Hart, to set
  his tender soul nearer unto my sufferings, and made him take my burdens
  on his back, and the yoak of my tribulation on his neck, and made him sup
  of my sore sorrows, and drink of the bleedings of my grief,'&mdash;</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>and so he goes on; but we do not learn what Thomas Hart did, except
  that he comforted John Perrot in his confinement.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Moreover," he says, "the everlasting mercies of my God did stir up
  the bowels of other two of his tender babes, named in the tent Jane
  Stokes and Charles Baylie, to come to visit me whilest I was as forsaken
  of all men."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>They persevered, he tells us,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"in their pilgrimage until they arrived to Rome, where C.&nbsp;B. offered
  his life to ransom me, and both of them entered into captivity for the
  love which they bore to my life."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>His <i>Narrative</i> (strictly speaking) contains no further
  information, but that at the bottom of the tenth page it is dated and
  signed,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Written in Rome Prison of Madmen. JOHN."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The remaining six pages of the pamphlet consist of a letter from
  Charles Baylie, giving an account of his pilgrimage with Jane Stokes,
  from Dover to Calais, Paris, Marseilles, Genoa, until</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Arriving," he says, "safe at Rome, we were drawn in our lives
  directly to the place where the dearly beloved J.&nbsp;P. was, and coming to
  the prison door, I enquired for him, and having answer of his being
  there, I desired for to speak with him, but it would not be permitted us;
  So it was said in me, <i>Write unto him</i>, which I did, the which he
  answered us in the fulness of love, which refreshed us after our weary
  steps; For our souls were refreshed one in another, though one another's
  faces we had never seen to the outward, and then we being kept in a holy
  fear not to do nor act one way nor other, but as we were moved of the
  Lord, least we should add to his bonds,&mdash;I say, being thus kept, we
  were delivered out of the snare of the fowler, who secretly lay in wait
  to betray our innocency; And after a little time the Lord showed me I
  should go to the inquisition, which I did, and enquired for the
  Inquisitor, as I was showed of the Lord I should do; and when I spoke to
  him I told him <i>I was come from England for to see my brother
  J.&nbsp;P.</i>; to which he answered, <i>I should see him</i>, and appointed
  me to come to a certain place called <i>Minerva</i>, and there, saith he,
  <i>I will procure you the liberty of the Cardinalls to see him</i>; he
  had me also to the Inquisition office, where he asked many questions of
  me concerning our religion, to which I answered in the simplicity of my
  heart in the fear of the Lord; and at the appointed time I came to the
  place aforesaid, and there I was showed what further I should do, which
  was to tender my body for my brother; and so from that time I hardly
  missed opportunity to speak to them as often as they met: for their
  manner was thus to meet twice a-week, the one time at <i>Minerva</i>, and
  the other time at <i>Monte-Cavallo</i>, where the Pope's own dwelling is,
  where I also did the like, more than once, which stirred them up against
  me, in great enmity," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I am afraid I am trespassing on your overfilled columns;
  but&mdash;omitting his account of his going to the Jews' synagogue, and
  of the command which he received to fast twenty days as a testimony
  against those who falsely stated that John Luffe had fasted nineteen days
  and died on the twentieth&mdash;omitting this, I must give one more
  extract. Having been detained in one of his visits to the <i>Minerva</i>,
  he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"From thence I was carried to the Inquisition, where I was shut up
  close, and after I had been there 3 dayes the Lord said to me, <i>Thou
  must go to the Pazzarella</i>, which was the Prison or Hospital of mad
  men, where our dear brother was prisoner; and it was also said unto me,
  <i>Thou shalt also speak to the Pope</i>; And at the 17 dayes end, I was
  led from the Inquisition towards the other prison, and by the way I met
  the Pope carried in great pomp; as it was the good will of the Lord that
  I should speak unto him, men could not prevent it, for I met him towards
  the foot of a bridge, where I was something nigh him, and when he came
  against me, the people being on their knees on each side of him, I cried
  to him with a loud voice in the Italian tongue, <i>To do the thing that
  was Just, and to release the Innocent</i>; and whilest I was speaking,
  the man which led me had not power to take me away until I had done, and
  then he had me to prison where my endeared brother was, where I fasted
  about 20 dayes as a witness against that bloody generation," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>As to how they got out, he only says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Soon after my fast, the Lord, by an outstretched arm, wrought our
  deliverance, being condemned to perpetual galley-slavery, if ever we
  returned again unto Rome."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It appears, however, that though thus prevented from exercising his
  office of a missionary in Rome, Charles Baylie did not relinquish it. In
  the letter just quoted he informs his correspondent (who this was does
  not appear), that since he had seen his face, he had been several times
  (as he was while <!-- Page 336 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page336"></a>{336}</span>writing) shut up in strong prisons; and
  the letter is dated</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The third of the sixth month, 1661. <i>From the Common Gaol in</i>

  perish."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>John Perrot seems to have considered that his mission extended over
  all the world. While in Rome Prison of Madmen, he wrote an address "To
  all people upon the face of the Earth," which he "sent thence the 8th of
  the 10th month, 1660;" and he was, no doubt, the author of the tract
  which follows it (and precedes the narrative) in my volume, entitled
  "Blessed openings of a day of good things to the Turks. Written to the
  Heads, Rulers, Ancients, and Elders of their Land, and whomsoever else it
  may concern," though it is only signed "JOHN." To him also, I suppose, we
  must ascribe another tract, <i>Discoveries of the Day-dawning to the
  Jewes. Whereby they may know in what state they shall inherit the riches
  and glory of Promise</i>. "J.&nbsp;P." is all that is given for the author's
  name on the title-page, but the tract is signed <span lang="he"
  class="heb" title="JWHN" ><bdo
  dir="rtl">&#x5D9;&#x5D5;&#x5D4;&#x5DF;</bdo></span>, that is, John. He
  too, I presume, was the author of another of the tracts, <i>An Epistle to
  the Greeks, especially to those in and about Corinth and Athens, &amp;c.
  Written in Egripo in the Island of Negroponte, by a Servant of the Lord:
  J.&nbsp;P.</i> He seems to have been at Athens on the 27th day of the 7th
  month, in the year accounted 1657, being the first day of the week, the
  day of Greek solemn worship, and to have been "conversant" with Carlo
  Dessio and Gumeno Stephaci, "called Greek doctors."</p>

<h3>SNAIL-EATING.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 221.)</p>

  <p>Snail-eating is by no means uncommon. When I was a youth I took a
  dozen snails every morning to a lady who was of a delicate constitution,
  and to whom they were recommended as wholesome food. They were boiled,
  and mixed up with milk. They were the common snail, usually found about
  old garden walls. A friend of mine, in walking round his garden, was in
  the habit of picking the snails off his fruit-trees and eating them raw.
  He was somewhat fastidious, for I have seen him take a snail, put it to
  his tongue, and reject it as not of a good flavour, and select another
  more agreeable to his taste. We are strange creatures of habit,
  especially in our feeding. I am fond of oysters, muscles, and cockles;
  but I do not think anything could induce me to taste a snail, a
  periwinkle, or a limpet.</p>

  <p class="author">B. H.</p>

  <p><i>Snail-eating.</i>&mdash;This practice is very general in Italy.
  While residing near Florence, my attention was often attracted by a heap
  of fifty or one hundred very clean, empty, snail-shells, in a ditch, or
  under a bush; and I indulged in many vain speculations, before I could
  account for so strange a phenomenon.</p>

  <p>One day, however, I happened to meet the <i>contadina</i> coming out
  of my garden with a basket on her arm; and from her shy, conscious
  manner, and an evident wish to avoid my seeing the contents, I rather
  suspected she had been making free with my peaches. To my surprise,
  however, I found that she was laden with the delicious
  <i>frutta-di-terra</i> (sometimes so called, as the Echinus, so common
  along the Italian coast, is called <i>frutta-di-mare</i>); and thinking
  that she had been collecting them simply from regard to my fruit and
  vegetables, I thanked her for her kind services. But she understood me
  ironically, and, with a good deal of confusion, offered to carry them to
  the kitchen, apologising most elaborately, and assuring me that she would
  on no account have taken them, had not our cook told her that we despised
  them, and that she would no doubt be welcome. I asked her what in the
  world she intended to do with them? and, with a look of amazement at my
  question, even surpassing mine at her reply, she informed me that her
  brother and his wife had come to pay them a visit, and that, with my kind
  permission, she would thus treat them to "<i>una bellissima cena</i>."
  She had collected about three quarts, during a search of two hours. The
  large brown kind only are eaten. Among the poor they are generally
  esteemed a delicacy, and reputed to be marvellously nutritious.</p>

<h3>SIR JOHN DAVIES, DAVIS, OR DAVYS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 82.)</p>

  <p>The following additional particulars of this eminent lawyer and poet
  may be deemed interesting. In a letter from Mr. Pary to the Rev. Josiah
  Mead, of the 26th November, 1626, it is stated:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Tomorrow, it is said Sergeant Richardson shall be Lord Chief Justice
  of the Common Pleas, and Sir John Davis nominated to the King's Bench,
  because he hath written a book in defence of the legality of this new
  Loan."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In another letter of the 9th December, 1626, it is stated:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"I heard last night that Sergeant Davis, who it is said looked to be
  Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench, in place of Sir Randal Crew, was
  found dead in his bed."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And, again, in a letter from the Rev. Josiah Mead to Sir Martin
  Stuteville, of the 16th Dec., 1626:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This of the death of Sir John Davis, for aught I <!-- Page 337
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page337"></a>{337}</span>can hear,
  holds true. It is added, that he was at supper with my Lord Keeper that
  evening before I was told by him that he should be Lord Chief Justice of
  the King's Bench; but he lived not to see the morning. My Lord of
  Huntingdon rode up, upon this news, for he is his heir."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Ferdinando Lord Hastings, eldest son of Henry, Earl of Huntingdon,
  married Lucy, daughter and heiress of Sir John Davis, and in 1613
  succeeded his father as Earl of Huntingdon.</p>

  <p>Sir John Davis married Lady Eleanor, only daughter of the Earl of
  Castlehaven, and sister of the infamous Earl. She remarried Sir Archibald
  Douglas, and died in 1652. She was the lady of the anagram celebrity,
  "Reveal, oh, Daniel," and "Never so mad a lady." There is no doubt that
  she and her brother were as mad as could well be.</p>

  <p>In a letter from Mr. Edward Rossingham to Sir Thomas Puckering, dated
  4th January, 1636, it is stated:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Sunday before Christmas the Bishop, Dean, and Chapter of Lichfield
  sent up a complaint against the Lady Eleanor Davis. It seems the
  cathedral church in Lichfield is lately very beautifully set out with
  hangings of arras behind the altar, the Communion table handsomely railed
  in, and the table itself set out in the best manner, and the Bishop's
  seat fairly built. This Lady came one Communion day, in the morning, with
  a kettle in one hand and a brush in the other, to sprinkle some of her
  holy water (as she called that in the kettle) upon these hangings and the
  Bishop's seat, which was only a composition of tar, pitch, sink-puddle
  water, &amp;c., and such kind of nasty ingredients, which she did
  sprinkle upon the aforesaid things. This being the act of a mad woman,
  the Lords, to prevent further mischief, have given out two warrants, the
  one to bring the Lady to Bethlehem, the other to the keeper of Bethlehem
  to receive her. There are messengers gone into Staffordshire to bring her
  up."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>It appeared afterwards she was so poor, that it became a question at
  the Council who should maintain her. She seems to have been wholly
  neglected by her second husband.</p>

  <p>Sir John Davis and his lady are buried in the church of St. Martin's
  in the Fields, and the following are their epitaphs, from Strype's
  <i>Stow</i>, book vi. p. 72.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"D. O. M. S. Johannes Davys, Equestris ordinis quondam Attornati Regis
  Generalis amplissima Provincia in regno Hib. functus. Inde in Patriam
  revocatus inter Servientes Domini Regis ad Legem primum locum sustinuit.
  Ob. 1626."</p>

  <p>"Acc&#x16B;bat dignissimo marito incomparabilis Uxor, &amp;c.,

  the Earl of Castlehaven, Baron Audley."</p>

<h2>Replies to Minor Queries.</h2>

  <p><i>Defoe's Anticipations</i> (Vol. iii., p. 287.).&mdash;Defoe had
  probably seen the English translation, or rather abridgment, of Father
  Dos Santos's <i>Ethiopia Oriental</i>, in Purchas's <i>Pilgrimes</i>
  (vol. ii. 1544, fol. ed.), in which some hints are given of the great
  lake (nyassi, <i>i. e.</i> sea) Maravi, which lies nearly parallel with
  the eastern coast, and was known to D'Anville, in whose map <i>Massi</i>
  is misengraved for Niassi. A very careful examination of the Portuguese
  expeditions across the continent of Africa has been given by Mr. Cooley,
  in the <i>Journal of the Royal Geographical Society</i> (vol. xv. p.
  185.; xvi. p. 138.), and he has ascertained, approximately, the extent
  and position of that great lake, which, from distrust of D'Anville, one
  of the most exact geographers, had been expunged from all modern maps. It
  is considerably to the N. and E. of the Nyami lately determined, and of
  much greater extent.</p>

  <p><i>Epitaph in Hall's Discovery</i> (Vol. iii., p. 242.).&mdash;The
  work entitled <i>Discovery of a New World, or a Description of the South
  Indies, hitherto unknown, by an English Mercury, imprinted by E.
  Blount</i>, no date, 12mo., is not, as our correspondent supposes, very
  rare, nor is it by Bishop Hall. It is a free translation, or rather
  paraphrase, and an excellent one in its way, by John Healey, of Bishop
  Hall's very entertaining <i>Mundus Alter et Idem</i>, first published in
  12mo., Francof., without date, afterwards reprinted with Campanella's
  <i>Civitas Solis</i> and Bacon's <i>Atlantis</i> at Utrecht, 1643, 24mo.,
  and subsequently included in the edition of Bishop Hall's works by Pratt,
  10 vols., Lond., 1808, 8vo. The epitaph quoted is not a satire upon any
  statesman of the time. The writer is describing the Land of
  Changeableness, or, as it is called in the Latin original, "Variana vel
  Moronia Mobilis," and gives in the course of his description this epitaph
  on Andreas Vortunius (a vertendo), or, as he is styled in the English
  <!-- Page 339 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page339"></a>{339}</span>translation, "Andrew Turncoate." The
  epitaph occurs in p. 132. of the Latin edition of 1643, and is evidently,
  as indicated by the marginal notes, an imitation or parody of the famous
  one on Æelia Lælia Crispis, which has exercised the ingenuity of so many
  writers, and of which our own countryman, Richard White, of Basingstoke,
  the historian, has given three different interpretations. See his <i>Ælia
  Lælia Crispis, Epitaphium Antiquum quod in Agro Bononiensi adhuc videtur,
  a diversis interpretatum varie, novissime autem a Richardo Vito
  explicatum</i>, Padua, 1568, 4to. An article on this epitaph and its
  various interpreters, of whom I have collected about forty, might be made
  a very interesting one.</p>

  of this epitaph, which you can use or not, as you please. If you think
  that it might help to "unearth" Mister Andrew Turnecoate, you may perhaps
  like to lay it before your readers; if, on the other hand, that it would

  needlessly, you can hand it over to "the Editor's best friend"&mdash;the

  <p>"Thomas Plantagenet. Before I proceed, I must confess myself formerly
  at a great loss to understand a passage in an honourable author, speaking
  of the counterfeit reliques detected and destroyed at the Reformation:
  'The Bell of Saint Guthlac, and the <i>Felt</i> of Saint Thomas of
  Lancaster, both remedies for the headache.' (Vice Lord Herbert's <i>Life

  (saving him of <i>Canterbury</i>) in any English Martyrology, till since,
  on enquiry, I find him to be this <i>Thomas Plantagenet</i>. He was Earl
  of Derby, Lancaster, Leicester, and (in the right of Alice his wife) of
  Lincoln. A popular person, and great enemy to the two Spencers, minions
  to King Edward II, who being hated as devils for their pride, no wonder
  if this Thomas was honored as a Saint and Martyr by the common sort.<a

  <p>It would appear from the foregoing extract that Thomas of Lancaster
  was never admitted into the Romish calendar of saints; though his memory
  was locally revered, especially for his opposition to the two Spencers,
  or Despensers, as they are called by Hume. This historian had no respect
  for "the turbulent Lancaster;" but the quaint old Fuller seems to have
  thought well of him.</p>

  <p>As a <i>bell-man</i> I am more interested in the virtues of the bell
  of Saint Guthlac, than in the hat of Saint Thomas, and I take this
  opportunity of asking assistance from the readers of "<span
  class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>" towards a collection of curious
  anecdotes and information about bells, which I am endeavouring to make.
  Any contributions will be thankfully received by me.</p>

  <p>"<i>Tickhill, God help me</i>" (Vol. i., p. 247.; Vol. ii., p.
  452.).&mdash;Although I am full late with my pendent, I am tempted to add
  the instance of "Kyme God Knows," well known to all explorers of the
  Fens. The adjunct, "God knows," is supposed to be part of the following
  verse:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"It's Kyme, God knows,</p>
      <p>Where no corn grows,</p>

  <p><i>Meaning of Tye</i> (Vol. iii., p. 263.).&mdash;On or contiguous to
  the South Downs, in Sussex, there are several portions of land bearing
  this designation, as Berwick Tye, Alfriston Tye, Telscombe Tye, &amp;c.
  They are all contiguous to the villages from which they derive their
  names. These lands were formerly held in common by the tenants of the
  respective manors, and I think the origin of the expression may be traced
  to the tethering or <i>tying</i>-up of cows, horses, &amp;c., for the
  double purpose of preventing their straying, and of preserving the fences
  of the neighbouring tenements. I offer this conjecture with some
  diffidence, because the word is very often found in <i>composition</i>
  with proper names of places, as Lavortye, Brambletye, Holtye, Puxtye,
  Ollantigh. The vulgar notion, that it means a space which originally
  measured ten acres, is, I think, untenable.</p>

  <p><i>Lost Manuscripts</i> (Vol. iii., pp. 161. 261.)&mdash;In pursuance
  of <span class="sc">Mr. Mackenzie's</span> suggestions respecting the
  search for lost manuscripts, permit me to ask, if all hope must be
  considered as given up of decyphering any more of those discovered at
  Herculaneum, or of resuming the excavations there, that have been so long
  discontinued? Perhaps the improved chemical processes of recent days
  might be found more successful in facilitating the unrolling of the MSS.,
  than the means resorted to so long ago by Sir H. Davy. Can any of your
  correspondents state whether anything has been done lately with the
  Herculaneum MSS.?</p>

  <p>Eustace says that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"As a very small part of Herculaneum has hitherto been explored, it is
  highly probable that if a general excavation were made, ten times the
  number of MSS. above mentioned (1800) might be discovered, and among
  them, perhaps, or very probably, some of the first works of antiquity,
  the loss of which has been so long lamented."&mdash;<i>Classical

  <p><i>The Circulation of the Blood</i> (Vol. iii., p.252.).&mdash;In a

  Portraiture of Old Age</i>, by John Smith, M.D., London, 1676, 8vo.,
  1752, 12mo., the author attributes the discovery of the circulation of
  the blood to King Solomon. Mede also finds the same anticipation of
  science in "the pitcher broken at the fountain." Who was the first to

  <p><i>Alliteration</i> (Vol. iii., p. 165.)&mdash;Your correspondent
  H.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;B., in quoting the seventh stanza from Phineas Fletcher's <i>Purple
  Island</i>, observes, that the second line,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"A life that lives by love, and loves by light,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>is "noticeable" for its <i>alliteration</i>. But the best specimen
  that I have met with in English&mdash;after having read much verse, and
  published a volume, which my partial friends call poetry&mdash;will be
  found in Quarles' <i>Divine Emblems</i>, book ii. emblem ii. Beyond all
  question, Quarles was a poet that needed not "apt alliteration's artful
  aid" to add to the vigour of his verse, or lend liquidity to his lines.
  Quarles is often queer, quaint, and querulous, but never prolix, prosey,
  or puling.</p>

  <p><i>Vineyards in England</i> (Vol. ii., p. 392.).&mdash;The Lincoln
  "Vine Closes" may as well be added to the rest. They were given to the
  church here by Henry I. See the charter, entitled <i>Carta Hen. I. de
  Vinea sua Linc.</i>, in Dugdale (Caley's) vol. vi. p. 1272. Their site is
  a rather steep slope, facing the south, and immediately east of the city.
  The southern aspect of our hill was celebrated long ago by some poet, as
  quoted by H. Huntingdon:</p>

  <div class="poem">

  <p>N.B. One of the Abbey fields at Bullington, a few miles east of
  Lincoln, is known as the Hopyard. The plant has never been cultivated in
  these parts within memory, or the range of the faintest tradition, but
  the character of the soil is clayey, and perhaps not unsuitable. Were
  hopyards often attached to monasteries? The house at Bullington was of
  the order of Sempringham.</p>

  <p><i>Countess of Desmond</i> (Vol. iii., p. 250.).&mdash;If your
  correspondents on this subject should be wandering to the south-east of
  London, they may be interested in knowing that there are two very
  striking portraits of this lady in Kent, one at Knowle, near Seven Oaks;
  the other, which is the more remarkable picture of the two, at Bedgebury,
  near Cranbrook, the seat of Viscount Beresford.</p>

  <p class="author">E. H. Y.</p>

  <p><i>St. John's Bridge Fair</i> (Vol. iii., pp. 88. 287.).&mdash;I
  cannot agree with the conjecture that this was Peterborough Bridge Fair.
  On the confines of Gloucestershire and Berkshire, at the distance of
  about 77 miles from London, near Lechlade, and on the road to Farringdon,
  is a St. John's Bridge, near which was a priory or hospital. It is at
  this place that the Thames first becomes navigable. (Leland's
  <i>Itinerary</i>, vol. ii. fo. 21, 22, 23; vol. iv. fo. 48; Bowles's
  <i>Post Chaise Companion</i>, 1782, pl. 28; Lysons' <i>Berkshire</i>,
  vol. i. p. 193., and map of county prefixed; <i>Collectanea Topographica
  et Genealogica</i>, vol. i. p. 320.; <i>Parliamentary Gazetteer</i>, art.
  "Lechlade.") Whether there is or ever was a fair at this place is more
  than I can state; but perhaps some of your correspondents dwelling in
  those parts can give information on this point.</p>

  <i>the errors almost all of them exist in the MS. from whence the

  makes for himself. "Good reader, if this impression have errors in it,

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>

  <p>The publication of <i>The National Cyclopædia of Useful Knowledge</i>
  has just been completed by the issue of <!-- Page 342 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page342"></a>{342}</span>the twelfth volume. We
  notice this useful condensation of <i>The Penny Cyclopædia</i>
  principally, however, for a feature which we hope to see more widely
  extended, namely, that of issuing it in a strong and handsome
  half-binding, at the moderate charge of one shilling per volume extra.
  The practice of publishing books in a bound form (more especially such
  books as are intended for very general circulation) is one which we have
  no doubt may be widely extended with great satisfaction to purchasers. It
  has, generally speaking, been, up to the present time, too closely
  confined to books of high price, adapted only to wealthy purchasers, whom
  the words "bound by Hayday," or "morocco extra," with the necessary
  increase of price, charm, rather than discourage.</p>

  <p>There is perhaps no work to which, at the present moment,&mdash;when
  the World's Fair is about to commence, and we are sure to be visited by
  hundreds, or rather thousands, of our Gallic friends, with whom we shall
  be in daily and hourly conversation,&mdash;we can more appropriately call
  the attention of our readers than to the second division (<i>Partie
  Française-Anglaise</i>) of M. Tarver's <i>Dictionnaire Phraséologique
  Royal</i>, in which we can assure them they will find the readiest
  solution of all those phraseological queries which may arise during their
  intercourse with our lively neighbours. A very cursory examination of its
  pages will serve to convince the inquirer of the great learning and
  patient industry of M. Tarver; and his interest in the work will not be
  diminished by the reflection that the name of its accomplished author
  will be found in the obituary of the present week.</p>

  <p>When noticing, a few weeks since, one of Captain Knox's interesting
  volumes, we spoke of the undying popularity of White's <i>Selborne</i>. A
  proof at once of this popularity, and a means of increasing it, will be
  found in a new edition of this delightful book just issued as one of the
  volumes of <i>Bohn's Illustrated Library</i>. It is entitled to its place
  in this series on account of forty admirable woodcuts by which it is
  illustrated; and to a place on the bookshelves of every Naturalist, for
  the sake of the additional notes of Sir W. Jardine, and its present
  editor, Mr. Jesse.</p>

  <p>Messrs. Puttick and Simpson (191. Piccadilly) will sell on Tuesday and
  Wednesday next an exceedingly choice Collection of Autograph Letters,
  comprising numerous Letters of extraordinary rarity, selected principally
  from Upcott's Collection. We cannot attempt to particularise the many
  interesting lots which are to be found in the present collection, but
  recommend the Catalogue to attention for the satisfactory manner in which
  the different documents are arranged and described.</p>
